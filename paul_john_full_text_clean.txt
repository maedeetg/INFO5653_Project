john,5paul“you don’t know about me without having heard a band by the name of tom petty and the heartbreakers but that’s okay” mike campbell writes in the introduction to his new book heartbreaker: a memoir (out march 18) “we played rock and roll together for a long time so much has been written about us some of it is even true but this is the first time one of us has tried to tell our story”  the book traces back through the epic saga of tom petty and the heartbreakers but also dives deep into campbell’s childhood his early struggles in the music world when he lived off bologna and oatmeal and his work outside the heartbreakers with bob dylan don henley and many other greats it also touches upon petty’s sudden death in 2017 and the difficult years that followed “a hydra of grief gripped me” campbell writes “numbness and sadness and resignation and disbelief – all jumbled no rhyme each feeling contradicting the next some setting in for black days of emptiness and loneliness”  long before that awful time campbell and petty were just two teenagers in gainesville florida desperate to find an outlet for their musical ambitions here’s a chapter from the book where campbell describes their first encounter  i didn’t sleep on that couch for very long dead or alive kept jamming at hal’s hippie house apartment but we were too loud to do that for much longer hal kept saying we needed to find some place out in the woods so we could play all day all night without all the hassle that’s what the allmans did he told us it sounded good to me i was sleeping on a couch in the middle of the living room of a small one-bedroom apartment with a married couple a place in the woods sounded great  hal found it  courtesy of hachette book group  it was a crumbling wood-frame farmhouse with a bowing tin roof and walls that leaned like four winos trying to hold one another up it was set in the middle of ten thick wooded acres on nw forty-fifth avenue the last avenue in gainesville there was no heat there was no hot water the refrigerator didn’t work the pipes sputtered rusty water rent was seventy-five bucks a month it was perfect editor’s picks  hal randall and i split the rent three ways and each got a bedroom sometimes our buddy red slater stayed in the gutted spidery laundry room not much bigger than a utility closet randall kept his drums up in the living room and we played for hours all day and all night as loud as we wanted  pretty soon all sorts of freaky weirdos were hanging out: hal’s best friend whitney and randall’s pretty girlfriend jean and red and all their friends and all their friends and on and on  there was no way to get back and forth to school except to catch rides with randall if i kicked in a quarter for gas money sometimes i had it sometimes i didn’t i lived on oatmeal which was all i could afford one day a little black-and-white kitten with no tail showed up on the porch and i took him in i named him frank i spent most of my time with him  frank would sit on my bed and listen to me play the guyatone for hours even days i would come up with a long swirling melody and record it on the wollensak then i would overdub a counter melody like i had learned about using pedal point and harmony then i would add additional movements and melodies and blend them all together i would lose all track of time school and vietnam and sherwood forest were all out there outside the music far away from me where i hoped they would stay  randall would poke his head in sometimes related content  “mike buddy you okay? you’ve been in here awhile like days maybe you should eat something”  it was so cold at night i would lie awake with my teeth chattering sleeping under all my laundry to stay warm and wait until the sun came up so i could stand outside i could tell nobody quite knew what to make of me i didn’t say a word for days on end i don’t know why i was getting skinnier and skinnier i was hungry all the time i wrote a letter to my dad who had moved back to the states he was living in georgia with his new wife mickey a wonderful japanese woman who was so sweet to me they had married soon after we left okinawa i asked my dad for fifty bucks i signed the letter “cadaverously yours mike”  he sent the money and i bought bologna and bread and an electric blanket i didn’t know what i was doing there i didn’t know what to study all i wanted to do was play music  i had nowhere else to go my mom married that guy and he immediately lost his job then he got another one—in england and then she was gone with my little brother and sister too i told myself well you’re alone in this world nobody is gonna save you nobody is gonna support you you’ll have to find your way on your own  hal and whitney would sit around the living room on the ripped couch and talk about sailing the world hal would spin long stories about how he was going to sail to hawaii and spend his life surfing the beaches of all the islands whitney said he wanted to sail around the entire world he had already gotten a small boat and was plotting the course of a practice run to the bahamas the night before he left we stayed up drinking boone’s farm wine and jamming for his send-off party he hippie danced all night right in front of me he left in the morning setting sail on a calm ocean without a cloud in the sky he was never seen again he sailed into the bermuda triangle and vanished  whitney disappearing made hal realize that life was fragile and fleeting we could be gone at any moment he told us he was leaving he told randall and me to keep playing we sounded good together a few weeks later he sailed to hawaii and he spent the rest of his life as a surfer there  one afternoon a few weeks after hal left with no money and no band and no ride home i wandered over to the plaza of the americas i sat in the grass alone and watched as one band broke down their drums and carried their amps off the stage and another carried theirs on how many bands were in this town? well one less anyway  hal had been such a big presence in the farmhouse it wasn’t the same without him there i felt like i was just drifting avoiding the draft waiting for the war to end waiting for something to come along to help make my life make sense  i thought what are you going to do? sit around and wait for a life to magically appear in front of you?  on the plaza stage the band that had set up looked to be squabbling the drummer was pointing his finger at a long-haired guitarist holding a red gibson es-335 with a bigsby tailpiece the bass player walked away from them shaking his head the drummer sat back behind the drums as the singer stepped up to the microphone the drummer counted them in and they launched into a tight driving take of the byrds’ version of “you ain’t goin’ nowhere”  the lead guitarist caught my ear first playing the stinging lloyd green pedal steel intro on the big gibson through a cranked fender dual showman making it cry with country bends he could really play the bass player was cool too skinny with long blond hair and a hofner viola bass like paul mccartney played he thumbed a loose grooving walking bass line that pushed and bounced through the song they both stepped up to the singer’s mic and together they sang the roger mcguinn gram parsons chris hillman three-part harmonies beautifully  the song ended a small round of applause rose up the drummer counted off again and they rolled into a two-chord country shuffle the singer stood back by the drums shaking a tambourine after a few bars the bassist stepped up to the mic and sang in a nasal twang that kept getting away from him but he looked sharp and he played bass just as good while he sang  back then everybody was trying to sound like the allman brothers nobody was playing this kind of tight byrds country rock—short songs with sweet harmonies and big choruses and long-haired hippie kids playing country music was still so far-fetched it was almost jarring you never saw any bands like that in gainesville i thought what a cool band i wondered who they were  the song ended and the blond bass player shrugged  “thanks we’re mudcrutch”  a few days later i was staring at guitars in lipham’s i wandered over to the bulletin board where local musicians posted flyers looking for gigs and band members i was thinking maybe it was time for me and randall to stop playing together it had been a year of jamming not really writing anything good hal was gone and i didn’t want to replace him with some random bass player i didn’t know what i was looking for i didn’t even know why i was looking  then that name caught my eye an index card in the middle of the board said mudcrutch needs    i got excited i moved another card that was blocking it drummer there was a phone number below it  i thought oh well no luck for me but it could be cool for randall like me randall had loved the byrds almost as much as the beatles but he said five seconds into sweetheart of the rodeo they lost him i thought at least he’d like the beatles harmonies i took the card off the board and stuck it in my pocket  i hitchhiked back to the farm when randall came home i gave him the card i asked him if he remembered me telling him about that band i saw he said no i said the band with the short songs and the harmonies kinda beatles-y?  randall said the country band you saw? he said yeah thanks but no thanks randall hated country music he associated it with every bully that had ever messed with him in bushnell i said they’re not like that they’re freaky they’re like us longhairs he said yeah right but he took the card a few nights later i was sitting on my bed playing guitar watching frank try to catch a stinkbug on the window randall knocked and stuck his head in he said he had played with that band mudcrutch over in the singer’s garage i asked him how it went he said he didn’t know he wasn’t sure he could play that country stuff and they couldn’t play too loud there and they had to cut it short after a few songs they might play again though out here just to give it another shot cool i said randall stood in the doorway for a minute while i played when i looked up he had shut the door  a few nights later i was doing the same thing—sitting on my bed playing my guitar unplugged while frank slept on the bed next to me—when i heard a car pull up randall answered the door and i heard voices but i couldn’t make out what they were saying i heard the heavy thump of bass notes randall hit his snare a few times loud power chords rang out someone said “check check” into a microphone  they kicked into “born to be wild” they were loud it sounded okay but it didn’t sound as good as when i had heard them on campus frank hid under my bed  they finished and i could hear they were talking a few minutes later there was a knock on my door randall and red came in randall said that band’s here mudcrutch  i said yeah i heard you guys in there  “well they were just now saying they usually have two guitar players but their rhythm guitar player quit they said they’d sound better with two guitars i told them you were good why don’t you come out and play?”  i shrugged and said i didn’t know about that red said you might as well man you’re in here playing anyway i said yeah i guess i wasn’t sure i was good enough i followed red and randall into the living room carrying the guyatone  two of the guys randall was playing with were sitting on the couch—the singer and the guitarist with the cool cherry 335 in his lap the skinny long-haired blond bass player stood with his back to me he turned when i walked in he sized me up quick and then glanced over at the guitarist with a look i couldn’t totally read but i could tell it was not “impressed”  my hair was still only revolver long i was wearing cut-off jean shorts and a baggy army shirt i was barefoot compared to the 335 my guitar looked like somebody had cut a guitar-shaped hole out of a door  the bass player turned and faced me his blond hair fell down to his shoulders he had a thin sharp face with blue eyes and high cherokee cheekbones he sized me up  “guys” randall said “this is mike” i looked down and said hey  the bass player was closest to me he stepped forward he had an air of confidence that pushed me back a little  he nodded  and then for the very first time i heard him say the words that i would hear him say countless times over the course of the next forty years he said them to me to bandmates to audiences he said them to lawyers to label heads to producers to promoters he said them to anybody he felt needed to hear them often he said them as an introduction a warm welcome but sometimes he said them to indicate that a particular line of discussion had now come to an end to serve as the final words on a matter to indicate that’s the end of that but not this time of course this first time i ever heard him say these words they were not the end of anything they were the very beginning  “i’m tom petty”  from the couch the guitarist stood and said hi he was tall with a handsome boyish irish face and long brown hair he said his name was tom too tom leadon leadon pointed to the big red-cheeked guy with a mustache who i recognized as the singer “that’s jim” jim lenahan  there was no way my little heathkit amp would keep up with the amps they were playing the fender dual showman and the big solid-state acoustic bass amp so leadon let me plug into the first channel of the showman  leadon quickly showed me the chords to the next song they were simple the verses were just g to c and the chorus was the same chords with an a minor thrown in front of them and a simple turnaround with an e minor and a d thrown in i picked it up easily and locked in with randall to drive it i watched leadon’s hands as he played bluegrass fills and a country solo it was so different from what i was used to hearing when i played with a band it sounded so melodic and purposeful so composed  as tom petty sang i realized it was the same song i’d heard him sing at the plaza of the americas “save your water woman i won’t drink out of your stream”  petty was a good bass player and randall played with him well when we finished leadon said wow you picked that up fast he sounded surprised but it was an easy song i told him it was a cool song i asked who it was by leadon said it’s by us he said tom wrote it i said really?  we weren’t sure what to play next randall spoke up  “hey maybe we can play something that mike can play lead on” “oh you play lead too?” leadon asked  he didn’t sound thrilled about it  back then bands typically followed either the beatles model or the stones model there was a rhythm guitar player who played rhythm exclusively and a lead guitarist who played the leads and fills in the beatles model the rhythm guitarist sang too in the stones model there would be a lead singer who didn’t play guitar  petty and leadon looked at each other and shrugged petty turned to randall and said like what?  randall smirked he knew what he was doing one country rock song was plenty for him  “how about ‘johnny b goode’?”  they looked surprised petty looked over at me “you can play ‘johnny b goode’? really play it?” i shrugged “yeah i guess”  leadon asked if i wanted to play the solo “sure if you want”  he asked if i wanted to play the intro i said sure if you want me to  i glanced over at randall he knew what was coming  i leaned over and turned up the volume knob on the dual showman’s first channel so it would cut through louder and dirtier i glanced over at randall he gave me a nod i rolled up the volume knob on the guyatone the single coil bridge pickup bu ed with a sixty-cycle hum  i looked over at petty “ready?”  and in the moment before he could say yes i let it rip hard i looked down at the fretboard as i played the big fast double stop triplets stinging the single string notes so they flew past as i slid down the g string then jumped up to the fifth fret and dug into the classic chuck berry bends before rounding into the a power chord to hit the shuffle  i looked up  randall hunched over his drums and played a fast ringo shuffle the other three were looking at me with wide eyes as they jumped into the song tom petty sang this one word for word while jim shook a tam- bourine i played the fills and the solo fast and loud and note for note they nailed the stops and starts right in time with me all three sang the chorus together and i answered with fast double stops we kept it short fast and tight and stopped together like we had been playing together for a year we all looked at one another stunned  next we played “honky tonk women” and leadon and i swapped leads back and forth i played a couple of grinding keith richards fills and leadon played melodic chromatic country and bluegrass runs randall who hadn’t played with a real bass player in over a year if ever clicked in with petty’s bass playing and gave everything a raucous thundering swing they didn’t have when i saw them on campus petty sang another song he wrote and jim sang the covers with a big bellowing soul shout and a clear strong falsetto on the harmonies  we took a break randall and i sat on the couch while the other three went out on the porch for about thirty seconds before they turned and came back in  “we want both of you to join the band” petty said “what do you say?”  i didn’t say anything randall said “we’re in”  they cheered we went out on the porch and pulled cans of beer off the rings of a six-pack somebody lit a joint someone said “to mudcrutch” and we laughed and said all together “to mudcrutch”  a little later randall and i were talking on the edge of the porch then he went inside to take a leak and tom petty walked up he stood right in front of me  he was skinny and several inches shorter than me but he somehow seemed bigger than he was everything about him looked put together and purposeful his clothes the way he stood how he talked it all seemed carefully crafted he had hypnotically blue eyes so blue it was hard not to look at them  he was smoking a joint he hit it and passed it to me “what are you doing?”  “just talking to randall”  “no i mean what are you doing?” “oh” i shrugged “i’m in school sorta”  “school huh?”  “yeah i don’t really know what i’m doing my dad thinks i should enlist”  “don’t do that”  “i don’t know what to do”  “you play like you know what to do”  he hit the joint again he was looking right at me “join the group”  “yeah”  “i mean for real full time”  “no i can’t do that i gotta stay in school my number’s eighty-six as soon as i drop out they’re gonna draft me”  he waved it off like he was brushing away a mosquito like that little thing? is that all that’s stopping you? getting sent to war?  “don’t worry about that we’ll take care of it”  he was so certain of what he was saying it was hard not to believe him he looked at me serious

john,0johnin the new showbiz comedy the studio bryan cranston has a recurring role as griffin mill the craven movie executive played by tim robbins in the 1992 film the player it’s not the only homage that the studio co-created by and starring seth rogen pays to robert altman’s classic movie satire every episode features at least one extended shot presented as a player-esque single shot aka a “oner” — the second episode called “the oner” is just that but the oners are usually presented in self-aware fashion with ike barinholtz’s executive sal complaining to new studio boss matt (played by rogen) “oners are so stupid it’s just the director jacking off while making everyone else’s lives miserable audiences do not care about this shit”  the target audience for the studio probably will though because the series is loaded with inside-baseball references from stars (zoë kravitz adam scott) and directors (martin scorsese ron howard) playing themselves to episodes built as elaborate pastiches to old movies like chinatown at its best it is simultaneously vicious and affectionate showing both a far greater command of its subject than hbo’s limp and superficial hollywood satire the franchise and a deeper level of fondness for it this is a show made by people who clearly love hollywood and who as a result understand exactly how to craft jokes about all the ways the town and its business are terrible  matt is a movie nerd who has turned his only interest into his career and who gets caught between desperation to hold onto his job in a rapidly-shifting industry and a gnawing suspicion that everything he does keeps making the medium he loves worse there’s a running thread through the season about griffin forcing matt to make a movie about the kool-aid man which goes about as well as you might expect and most of the other films being pitched by sal and by matt’s former assistant quinn (chase sui wonders) sound nearly as bad editor’s picks  “the oner” is an excellent example of many of the things the series — created by rogen evan goldberg (who co-directs every episode with rogen) peter huyck alex gregory and frida perez — does well as director sarah polley(*) attempts to conclude her latest film not only with a oner but one filmed at the golden hour right before sunset matt finds himself continually getting in the way through a mixture of slapstick neuroses and oblivious hollywood egotism it’s a stunt about a stunt and one that mocks the self-importance of the device while also showing how effective it can be(**) and it’s an excellent use of

is incredibly funny in playing her fictionalized self’s struggle to conceal her disdain for matt olivia wilde is terrific in the chinatown spoof and howard’s comic timing remains so sharp it once again makes me wish he would occasionally take an acting job where he isn’t playing himself (he’s only done that a couple of times in the 40 years since happy days ended most recently in a skype cameo on an episode of the matthew perry-thomas lennon odd couple remake in 2016) a later episode features another actor turned director rebecca hall — not playing herself but playing matt’s new girlfriend a pediatric oncologist as someone who still acts in between filmmaking gigs hall is probably more famous than polley so it’s odd to cast her as a civilian character  (**) though even “the oner” is upstaged a bit by debuting a few weeks after netflix’s brilliant all-oner miniseries adolescence related content  rogen and barinholtz are in every episode while the loaded supporting cast comes and goes based on the needs of the plot (and perhaps the other actors’ schedules) as patty matt’s ousted predecessor catherine o’hara is the most understated she’s been in forever (maybe going back to a

funniest when it’s presenting things through a cinematic lens episodes where the business isn’t as central to the plot are less successful than ones that couldn’t take place in any other setting like an outing where matt begins to fear that casting ice cube as kool-aid man is racist like the movie business itself it’s hit-or-miss but when it hits — like a season-ending two-parter that serves as a

john,2johnhere’s a toast to the happy couple for selena gomez and benny blanco turning their love story into an album is the least they could do i said i love you first is a valentine that delivers exactly what it promises — a pop icon and a superstar producer celebrating a real-life romance that we all can root for as selena once sang it’s just like the battle of troy — there’s nothing subtle here these two crazy kids are young they’re in love and they can’t keep their hands to themselves — well they could but why would they want to?  selena and benny really had no choice but to make this album since they’ve already consummated their romance in the most public and official way — eating spicy wings on their instant-classic episode of hot ones (benny after tasting the sicilian scorpion sauce: “i feel like i would have crumbled without her” selena: “you did crumble”)  but there’s a long pop tradition of valentine albums like this: who can forget when cher and gregg allman made their newlywed album together as allman and woman two the hard way? or john lennon and yoko ono making entire albums where they did nothing but sigh each other’s names for minutes at a time? beyoncé and jay-z taking over the louvre for everything is love? so why shouldn’t selena and benny celebrate their passion with songs about getting naked in the middle of sunset boulevard and touching in the summer rain?  selena and benny have worked together since long before they fell in love and their musical chemistry is a crucial part of her story ten years ago he was there when she found her adult voice on revival one of the era’s most innovative and influential pop albums she spent that album getting a load of the poison bad-relationship mojo out of her system but hey now ain’t the time for your tears about whatever our girl might have suffered in her past romantic history because as her pal taylor likes to sing all’s well that ends well editor’s picks  since revival her music output has been sparing — her 2020 comeback rare and her 2021 spanish-language ep revelacion but she’s just kept building her legend as one of the most universally beloved of pop icons the one who did a cooking show from her mansion selena  chef based on the premise that until then she’d never even set foot in her own kitchen she also revved up her acting career with only murders in the building stealing scenes from no less than steve martin and martin short remember just last month when the team won at the screen actors guild awards and selena announced “marty and steve aren’t here because you know they don’t really care”? who else but selena could give that line such an angel-face knife twist?  i said i love you first is crafted as a story spanning the years — it begins with a recording of the young selena giving her weepy speech at the wrap party for the wizards of waverly place when she was just a disney child star the couple invite plenty of their famous friends along teaming up with finneas for “scared of loving you” (“if i lose my shit promise not to laugh/if i throw a fit and get photographed”) gracie abrams bonds with selena in the boppy pop-rock duet “call me when you break up” there’s even “i can’t get enough” a years-old collab with j balvin and tainy that already charted back in 2019 trending stories ‘lives are in danger’ after a trump admin spreadsheet leak sources say im 73 heavy metal just changed my life the white lotus episode 7: sleeping with the frenemy something important is missing in the signal scandal  the album peaks in the middle with a trio of bangers starting with “sunset blvd” a romantic fantasy of coupling in the middle of the street until the cops arrive to pry them apart selena serenades benny with lines like “woman of few words but for you i’d keep my mouth wide open” it builds up to the austin powers-style raunch of the chorus where she pants “i want that big big hard…heart!” “cowboy” is a sensually lazy sex-on-the-range ballad one of the album’s many tributes to lana del rey then takes a comic swerve at the end with an out-of-nowhere filthy guest rap from glorilla “bluest flame” is their fantastic disco reunion with longtime collaborator charli xcx who makes the song feel like a very brat wedding toast  “we live in a cruel world benny” selena informed her man on hot ones so true but selena and benny are doing their best to make it a little less cruel with the hopes and dreams of i said i love you first let’s hope we get many sequels to this album over the years to come because the world needs all the uplifting pop-star love stories we can get
john,3johndinner with dj koze is delightful he shows me to a thai restaurant in central hamburg down some steps and into a curtained room bubbling with atmosphere and charm he studies the menu as though searching for secret meanings then orders the pho which is what he always gets then he laughs at my face as two beers arrive  “it’s the first time i’ve seen you smile” he says i’m sure it’s not true as he’s been amusing company all afternoon a short while later he’s finished his beer and seems unable to concentrate on our conversation until he gets another one after many efforts to get the attention of the staff a young waitress appears and koze spends five minutes talking to her in german making her laugh shyly as she politely switches to english to see if i too am still thirsty i ask if she knows who she’s just been talking to she says no now koze smiles it’s not the first time i’ve seen him smile today but it’s the most infectious smile i’ve seen in months  for 30 years koze has made music that captures the feeling of finding happiness in spite of it all of smiling through a face full of tears laughing between sobs and realising that even now with all that’s happening in the world there is beauty out there his trademark house techno and genre-agnostic psychedelia is wonderfully impossibly bittersweet and his story so far is equally contradictory he would be easy to classify as another enigma of electronic music resistant to interviews and elusive in his public appearances but over the years he’s talked to many a journalist almost every one of whom has remarked that although he’s a reluctant interviewee he’s fun to talk to and generous with his time  during the six hours i spend with him i find this to be true he’s promoting his sixth solo album music can hear us but he states early on that the interviews he finds least interesting are those that obsess over “the product” he talks zealously about the album artwork painted by his girlfriend of many years gepa hinrichsen but won’t tell me where he made the music or how long it took him “write 10 years” he says “and write in florida japan australia you can make up stuff the truth behind the musical process is often boring”  editor’s picks  the music he makes is subtle intangible but never boring it has impressed many people earning him official remix rights to songs by jamie foxx peggy gou caribou and gorillaz plus the production of an entire album by irish singer roísín murphy swedish star robyn credited koze’s 2014 track “xtc” as the inspiration behind her last album the koze effect is epitomized by the lead single from his 2018 album knock knock a two-chord masterpiece called “pick up” possibly the finest work of house music of the past 25 years “pick up” is so good instances of djs playing it at various events have become semi-famous take laurent garnier who played the song to a gleeful barcelona crowd shortly after its release sending them and more than 70000 viewers into bedlam or ricardo villalobos who closed his sunrise set at the houghton festival in 2019 by playing two copies of the “pick up” vinyl at the same time  best of all is the clip of koze himself playing the song at the sydney opera house with murphy on vocals one chord appears to speak to the other sounding almost impudent in their simplicity equal parts ecstatic and heartbreakingly melancholic “i guess neither one of us wants to be the first to say goodbye” murphy sings in time with a 50-year-old gladys knight sample then the beat drops and the room erupts dancers throwing their hands in the air with abandon if you watch at home you’ll face an internal struggle between cheering and bursting into tears  koze was born stefan kozalla a hip-hop kid who grew up in flensburg in northern west germany in the 1970s and 1980s his dad was an attorney and koze says his first memory of music is hearing his mom singing — “mother radio” — although he stops short of revealing any more (“you have to make a story out of it”) he once told a journalist he was found as a child clutching an akai sampler in a forest in marrakech related content  in the nineties he produced music for the hamburg hip-hop four-piece fischmob whose 1998 album power offers a glimpse into a parallel world where the pharcyde rapped in german while in fischmob he started calling himself dj koze which most english-speaking listeners pronounce “cozy” koze himself used to say “coat-zuh” like the german word kotze meaning vomit but he has long since ceased to care how it’s pronounced  now in his fifties koze is approaching an age when people might rightly describe him as avuncular earlier in our encounter we met at the deichtorhallen hamburg’s preeminent modern-art gallery for a retrospective featuring the work of swiss painter franz gertsch koze greeted me not with words but with sweets offering me a handful of hard-boiled zuckerfrei (sugarfree) candies in colorful wrappers i accepted and began to unwrap one but he stopped me  “no no” he said “that one is really hardcore start with this one” i took his advice and had the one wrapped in pink (sage) but couldn’t resist the temptation for long and soon plunged for the green (eucalyptus) my mouth briefly ignited and he laughed at my reaction before explaining that he uses the sweets to satisfy his natural urge for a vice “it’s really intense it stops me craving something to eat or drink” as we browsed the exhibition koze marveled at gertsch’s canvases most of them depicting mundane situations in glistening detail “i love how he is not painting anything big or iconic but finding beauty by focusing on small things”  after fischmob koze started international pony an electro-pop trio with a few minor hits to their name before launching his solo career with a string of albums stretching over more than 20 years in 2005 he released two solo lps one under his regular stage name and another more experimental record under the alias adolf noise at the risk of invoking an old trope of anglo-germanic repartee i ask him if the name was a nazi joke (our respective nations fought a couple of fairly serious wars a while ago) “it is less a nazi joke” he says “more a word joke just a wordplay”  koze once described hamburg as “so small and boring and far away” but the city was once known as a debaucherous hub of creativity not far from here in 1960 the beatles played at various nightclubs in hamburg’s red-light district having left liverpool on the advice of their manager onstage john lennon was known to tease his german audience by holding a comb over his upper lip lifting his arm in a nazi salute and shouting “heil hitler!” apparently some people found it quite amusing but those who didn’t would sometimes rush the stage prompting club bouncer horst fascher to step in and protect the band  years later around 1990 fascher’s son david fascher sat on a judging panel as a young dj koze competed in the dmc dj’ing championships koze says he invented a trick where he would place one spinning turntable on top of another balanced on four shot glasses the following year fascher competed at the dmc final at wembley arena in london and did the same trick “this was my idea” says koze “he stole it and he won”  back to hitler “twenty-five years ago we could make fun of it because it was so far away” says koze “now it’s newly relevant and it’s not funny now” we’re talking not long after a day of interviews with the german press many of whom asked him what adolf noise would say to alice weidel the leader of germany’s resurgent far-right party afd (alternative für deutschland)  four days after our conversation germans go to the polls the afd make unprecedented gains becoming the second-biggest party in the country the results prompt elon musk who appeared to give a nazi salute at a rally a month earlier to congratulate weidel for her party’s performance  “in the moment there’s not one telephone call i have with friends which is not in the end political” koze says “we used to talk shit and talk about music but now it’s always did you see yesterday? normally we could fade out or avoid talk about that ’cause it’s a bit boring but it’s fucking not boring anymore it’s like alarming”  nonetheless he only sees benefit in trying to remain positive because doom-mongering “doesn’t make the world a better place i think you don’t say you lose until you lose you fight it’s the same in bjj you don’t tap until you’re forced to”  this is one of many references koze has made to brazilian jujitsu his most treasured pastime he’s now a black belt in the martial art and says he could speak for 10 hours about its benefits “i have more friends in the bjj scene where people even now don’t know what i’m doing more or less — oh yeah you make music? — than in the music scene”  friends or not koze has worked with some big names including damon albarn on music can hear us’ lead single “pure love” in 2015 koze said “i’m not gay at all but a little bit i could imagine with damon albarn”  “did i really say that?” koze says snickering “i don’t really know him but as an artistic figure he is like a role model for me how you can get old with dignity be so open-minded how you spend every day of your life making music and of course the musical genius his expression how he sings for me he has a magic voice it just hits me”  he met albarn at coachella in 2022 they were in adjacent trailers and with koze having remixed a gorillaz track in 2019 albarn introduced himself they drank champagne and spoke about the writings of hermann hesse and albarn showed koze that he speaks a little german albarn may well have aged with dignity as koze says but shortly afterward billie eilish brought the gorillaz frontman onstage during her headlining set and some of her fans mistook him for her dad  after dinner i pause the recording and we head out in search of more liquor koze ducks into a newly opened asian food store and his eyes light up as he browses the snacks he buys us a coconut each and off–the-record tells me some stories about the recording process behind music can hear us i’ve forgotten the details but i remember it was wild — something about waking from a dream to discover 15-minute songs staring back at him from his laptop composed and recorded with his faculties asunder  as we settle in a plush hotel bar he spends several minutes studying the slope of the floor firing up a conversation with the german concierge to confirm there is in fact a slight descent to the terrain before reporting the discovery to me as though it changes everything two gin and tonics arrive and i recite the lyrics from “pure love” sung by albarn: “i told you i was ok … but that was not true” i ask dj koze: is he ok?  “ambitious” he says eyes twinkling “um no i’m not ok i’m trying to look at this mess and sort it out finally” is it his job to sort out this mess? “to sort out my mess? yeah that’s my job to become a human being which is in peace somehow with everything” so he doesn’t feel at peace with himself? “i think not to the outside i pretend to but i think it’s difficult times for me”  the roots of his mental unrest remain abstract but perhaps he is simply another creature suffering the symptoms of a fractured world our interview is challenging the truth seeming to flit around us like some un-shazamable song but most enjoyable conversation drifts from politics to music to sport to comedy he likes the new single by jorja smith and aj tracey; “em2500 m253x” by aphex twin; “sexy sadie” by the beatles; amapiano (electronic music’s last great “earthquake”); and burna boy he still harbors ambitions of producing music for pop stars but quickly rows back the idea in a moment of typical self-contradiction because “there must be a bigger idea than a white boy trying to make afrobeats for burna boy”  he enjoys hannah gadsby old louis ck he also likes ricky gervais’ extras and we debate the series’ greatest moment before agreeing upon robert de niro’s guest appearance in which stephen merchant asks the actor if he’s ever driven a taxi for real before gifting him a pen with a woman on it whose clothes fall off when you turn it upside down  after more drinks we walk the streets by coincidence it turns out my night’s accommodation is on the same street as koze’s home a flat he’s occupied for more than two decades it also happens to be hamburg’s roughest neighborhood koze points out a restaurant where he says a teenager recently shot someone a doner kebab shop that was recently raided because its owners were selling heroin and at the entrance to his building a seedy fart leaving with an apparent sex worker the scene recalls nothing so much as de niro’s sultry narration in taxi driver trending stories ‘lives are in danger’ after a trump admin spreadsheet leak sources say im 73 heavy metal just changed my life the white lotus episode 7: sleeping with the frenemy something important is missing in the signal scandal  koze says he feels safe in hamburg and by contrast calls berlin the german capital “a shithole” he pauses outside his building as if to consider inviting me in he decides against it — i suspect — to keep some of his remaining enigma intact to avoid revealing how the bratwurst is made or maybe just to sleep off the booze he texts me later suggesting ways for me to spend the next morning chiefly a visit to reeperbahn the street on which john paul george and ringo played together for the first time in the february sun i creep around the place like a kid in a zuckerfrei sweet shop  i forgo the fab four in the earphones however opting instead for music can hear us it’s a magnificent album one that requires many listens before it will reveal its beautiful secrets to you koze named it after a belief that music can offer us precisely what we need in this trying time: “it can feel our pain our destiny our euphoria our wishes our demands it’s somehow political also” do it reader listen five 10 100 times listen as koze speaks to you in the universal unknowable language of chords and keys and rhythm listen closely enough and you might just hear it listening back
