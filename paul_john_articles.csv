Backed by the Roots, the New Orleans rapper performed an explosive career-spanning medley of his hits, including “Uproar,” “Lollipop,” “6 Foot 7 Foot,” “Mrs. Officer,” and the finale, “A Milli.”

The performance follows his announcement that Tha Carter VI is finally arriving this summer. Five days before the Big Game he wanted to play (but got over it and wished Kendrick Lamar “all the best”), he teased he had “a special announcement” to make later that week. Two days later, he unveiled the release date for the long anticipated album, which will arrive on June 6. He revealed the news in an extended Cetaphil commercial titled “We’re all a lil Sensitive,” a cheeky play on his disappointment in not being chosen to helm the Super Bowl halftime show.

SNL50: The Anniversary Special featured a bevy of musical guests. Sabrina Carpenter and Paul Simon opened the show with a performance of “Homeward Bound”; Miley Cyrus, Brittany Howard, and the Roots paid tribute to Sinead O’Connor, performing the Prince-penned “Nothing Compares 2 U”; and Paul McCartney closed out the show with a medley of Beatles songs, including “Golden Slumbers,” “Carry That Weight,” and “The End.”",paul

The Pretenders’ Chrissie Hynde, director Jim Jarmusch, former Bangles frontperson Susanna Hoffs, Irish singer-songwriter Glen Hansard, and New York rocker Jesse Malin have been added to an already eclectic lineup of singers and musicians partaking in “People Have the Power: Celebrating the Music of Patti Smith” at Carnegie Hall on March 26.

The concert, timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Smith’s classic Horses album, was first announced last November. The initial list of participants, spanning alt rock, classical, and current indie, included Michael Stipe, Sharon Van Etten, Matt Berninger of the National, Karen O, Kim Gordon, Ben Harper, Courtney Barnett, the Kronos Quartet, Angel Olsen, and the Kills’ Alison Mosshart.

The house band has also been expanded: former Heartbreakers keyboardist Benmont Tech and guitarist Charlie Sexton will now be joining Flea, Smith’s bassist-keyboardist Tony Shanahan, and drummer Steve Jordan to back all the singers. Jarmusch will be reading from some of Smith’s writings and poetry.

Produced by Michael Dorf Presents, the concert also marks the 20th edition of City Winery founder Dorf’s “The Music of …” series of music-education benefit shows. Past honorees have included Paul McCartney, Joni Mitchell, Bruce Springsteen, Led Zeppelin, R.E.M., David Bowie, and Prince.

Smith herself hasn’t released an album of new material since 2012’s Banga, but has been active with books, poetry, and other outside-music endeavors. Her latest project, “Correspondences,” is a video installation collaboration with Stephan Crasneanscki, whose Soundwalk Collective compiles sound recordings from around the planet. Among its short films are those devoted to the resilience of nature after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster and, most timely, a history of wildfires over the past 70 years. Currently at the Kurimanzutto Gallery in New York through Feb. 22, the exhibition features Smith’s voice: reciting lyrics over ambient music by Soundwalk Collective.",paul

While accepting an award for his film Dream Scenario at the Saturn Awards, the actor cautioned against compromising creativity by “letting robots dream for us,” noting that he finds the use of AI to be “disturbing.”

“Robots cannot reflect the human condition for us,” Cage said. “That is a dead end if an actor lets one AI robot manipulate his or her performance even a little bit, an inch will eventually become a mile and all integrity, purity, and truth of art will be replaced by financial interests only. We cannot let that happen.”

The speech comes just weeks after Paul McCartney and Elton John issued their own warnings against a potential copyright law that would allow AI to train on artists’ work. During his speech, Cage recognized the threat of AI as a broader problem that exists across mediums.

“The job of all art in my view, film performance included, is to hold a mirror to the external and internal stories of the human condition through the very human thoughtful and emotional process of recreation,” he continued. “A robot cannot do that. If we let robots do that, it will lack all heart and eventually lose edge and turn to mush. There will be no human response to life as we know it. It will be life as robots tell us to know it.”

The caution against using AI also follows backlash to Brady Corbet’s Academy Award-nominated film The Brutalist. The film’s editor Dávid Jancsó recently admitted to using AI in the film to render a “series of architectural drawings and finished buildings” in addition to enhancing Adrien Brody and Felicity Jones’ Hungarian dialogue to sound more authentic. The editor maintained that “there’s nothing in the film using AI that hasn’t been done before,” per Variety.

“We should be having a very open discussion about what tools AI can provide us with,” Jancsó said. “We use AI to create these tiny little details that we didn’t have the money or the time to shoot.”

A previous version of this story referenced Nicolas Cage’s 2022 film The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent as an example of the use of AI. That reference has been removed.",paul

Noteworthy ones like George Harrison’s I, Me, Mine (1980), Iggy Pop’s I Need More (1982), and David Lee Roth’s Crazy From the Heat (1997) popped up every once in a while, but it wasn’t until the 2000s that this genre started making regular appearances on The New York Times bestseller list, thanks to landmark works like Anthony Kiedis’ Scar Tissue, Bob Dylan’s Chronicles: Volume One, Eric Clapton’s The Autobiography, Keith Richards’ Life, and Patti Smith’s Just Kids.

In recent years, everyone from Bruce Springsteen to Cher to Billy Idol, Debbie Harry, Elton John, Gregg Allman, Neil Young, Brian Wilson, Mike Love, Rod Stewart, Morrissey, Johnny Marr, Thurston Moore, and Kim Gordon have all written their own books. But there’s still a long list of stubborn holdouts. Here’s a look at nine of them, and the likely reasons they have yet to share their stories with the world.

Why Hasn’t It Happened? Jagger has come extremely close to publishing a memoir at numerous points over the past few decades, even inking a deal with a publisher once and picking a ghostwriter. But he always gets cold feet at the last moment. “When I actually started to get into it, I just didn’t enjoy reliving my life,” Jagger said in 2021. “So I just said: ‘I can’t be bothered with this,’ and gave the money back. If you wanna write an autobiography, you can’t do it in a week. It takes a lot out of you. It takes a lot of reliving emotions, reliving friendships, reliving ups and downs … I just didn’t enjoy the process.” Editor’s picks

Will It Happen? Most likely not. The Rolling Stones grossed $235 million for playing just 20 concerts in 2024. The money he stands to make from even a huge bestseller cannot come close to that, and it would require a lot more work and hassle. Also, Jagger has lived many lifetimes over the past eight decades. As he suggested, that’s a lot of memories that he’s probably not in a hurry to relive. We have memoirs from Keith Richards, Ronnie Wood, and Bill Wyman, along with countless other books about the Stones. They’ll just have to do.

Why Hasn’t It Happened? George Harrison released I, Me, Mine in 1980, and Paul McCartney teamed up with Barry Myles in 1993 for Paul McCartney: Many Years From Now, which isn’t technically an autobiography, but was based on 35 hours of interviews, and fully authorized by McCartney. Starr, however, has refused to pen his own book. “I’ve been asked to write my autobiography and really they only want eight years,” he told Rolling Stone in 2012, referring to the time he spent in a certain Sixties rock band. “And I keep saying it would be five volumes before I even got into the band.”

Will It Happen? It would be a fantastically perverse move if Starr indeed published five books that don’t even get the reader to 1962. And while we’d love that Rory and the Hurricanes book, there’s not much of a market for it. If this is ever going to happen, he’d likely need to relent and focus at least half of a single-volume book on the Beatles. He doesn’t seem eager to do that now, and at age 84, the clock is ticking pretty fast. We’re betting against this one too.

Why Hasn’t It Happened? Simply put, she doesn’t want to piss everyone off. “The world is not ready for my memoir, I guarantee you,” Nicks told Billboard in 2014. “All of the men I hung out with are on their third wives by now, and the wives are all under 30. If I were to write what really happened between 1972 and now, a lot of people would be very angry with me. It’ll happen some day, just not for a very long time. I won’t write a book until everybody is so old that they no longer care. Like, ‘I’m 90, I don’t care what you write about me.’ I am loyal to a fault. And I have a certain loyalty to these people that I love because I do love them, and I will always love them. I cannot throw any of them under the bus until I absolutely know that they will not care.” Related Content

Will It Happen? A smart move would be to write the book now and hold it back until everyone she might offend is gone. If she doesn’t even start until all of her exes are dead or senile, it’ll likely never happen. We’d say this one is a 50/50 proposition, at best.

Billy Joel

Why Hasn’t It Happened? Back in 2011, Joel took a $3 million advance from Harper Collins and teamed with former Rolling Stone writer Fred Schruers for a memoir titled The Book of Joel. But at the very last minute, when the book was just two months away from hitting and copies had already been sent out to the press, Joel returned the money and pulled the plug on the whole thing. “It took working on writing a book to make me realize that I’m not all that interested in talking about the past,” Joel said, “and that the best expression of my life and its ups and downs has been and remains my music.” Three years later, Schruers repurposed the material into Billy Joel: The Definitive Biography.

Will It Happen? For someone of Joel’s immense wealth, $3 million is pocket change. He makes that playing a single stadium concert. If he wasn’t interested in 2011, there’s little reason to think he’ll be interested again in 2031 unless he starts feeling nostalgic and wants to tell his story before it’s too late. The odds seem against this one.

Robert Plant

Why Hasn’t It Happened? Much like Ringo Starr, Plant faces an issue where publishers are only interested in one portion of his life. And a lot of crazy shit went down during that period that he’s not anxious to dredge up. “We were representing a challenge to the order,” Plant told Classic Rock in 2017. “So, do we want to chum up and cuddle up on the whole idea of going to a publisher and telling stories? I mean, what — who — for? Those stories are locked nicely between my two ever-growing ear holes. So fuck it. There’s a lot in there, and that’s where it’s staying.”

Will It Happen? When Plant doesn’t want to do something, he doesn’t do it, period. A Led Zeppelin reunion tour would make him substantially more than any book, and he hasn’t done that, either. Both endeavors would force him to spend significant time in the past when he’d rather look forward. This one is never, ever happening.

Why Hasn’t It Happened? Back in the Seventies, the Eagles hired Fugs frontman Ed Sanders to write their official band biography. Henley even gave him his original Hotel California lyric manuscripts. But Henley didn’t like Sanders’ first draft, and the whole endeavor got brushed to the side when the group broke up. Decades later, the Hotel California papers wound up at the center of a legal mess in New York that’s way too complex to get into here. But the whole thing quite possibly soured Henley on the idea of a memoir.

Will It Happen? The infamous Sanders book will never see the light of day. But it’s possible that Henley will decide it’s time to tell his own story at some point. Right now, he’s making an astonishing amount of money playing the Sphere as part of the Eagles’ ongoing farewell tour. A book probably won’t even be a thought until the band finally wraps up their career for real.

Why Hasn’t It Happened? With six kids, regular world tours, charity work, the occasional movie, and yet another album in the works, Madonna simply hasn’t had time to sit down and write out the story of her life. It has been on her mind, though. ”I’m sure I will one day,” she said in 2015. “I’ve got so many tales to tell. If I wrote my book that would be from start to finish. And that’s a whole lot of ground to cover.”

Will It Happen? Before she gets to work on any book, Madonna needs to finish the biopic about her life she’s been threatening to direct for years. The movie appeared to be dead in 2023, but she brought it back to life last year with help from Secretary writer Erin Cressida Wilson. Once that is in the can, and it is still quite possibly several years away, she can maybe start thinking about a book. Whenever it happens, it’ll be a very, very big deal.

Why Hasn’t It Happened? Rose has more alleged skeletons in his closet than the vast majority of people on this planet. If you doubt us, just google “Erin Everly lawsuit” or the lyrics to “One in a Million.” We can’t imagine he’d like to go over the events of the late 1980s and early 1990s in a book. He won’t grant interviews these days even to talk about the present. And with Guns N’ Roses back in stadiums following the 2016 reunion with Slash and Duff, he certainly doesn’t need the money.

Will It Happen? Nah. Axl is basically invisible to the world when he’s not onstage with GN’R. It’s clearly the way he prefers it. Writing a book means not just talking about your past, but going on a media tour to sell the damn thing. Can you imagine him signing books at Barnes & Noble and taking photos with fans? We can’t either.

Why Hasn’t It Happened? There’s an official Pearl Jam book that the band published in 2011 to commemorate its 20th anniversary. But Vedder has never even hinted that he wants to write a memoir. He doesn’t have skeletons like Axl Rose, but he also is a private person who is not eager to dive deep into his past. It’s nearly impossible, for example, to imagine him writing about divorcing his first wife, Beth Liebling, or the details of how Pearl Jam parted ways with all four drummers prior to Matt Cameron.

Will It Happen? Believe it or not, Vedder just turned 60. Pearl Jam are still going strong, even if they’ve dramatically cut the running time of their concerts. The day may come when they stop touring at all and Vedder feels like putting his saga down on paper. But we’re likely a long, long way away from that day.",paul

McCartney began on piano with “Golden Slumbers,” singing about getting “back homeward”–a fitting conclusion to a show that began with Paul Simon and Sabrina Carpenter performing “Homeward Bound,” which Simon and George Harrison played on SNL in 1976.

As is the case on Abbey Road, “Golden Slumbers” segued into “Carry That Weight,” and then “The End,” with McCartney hopping up from the bench during the drum solo and picking up his electric guitar.

After a solo of his own, McCartney sang the final lines of the song–“And in the end / The love you take /

Is equal to the love you make”–and then thanked those in the studio audience.

Sunday marked McCartney’s fifth time as SNL musical guest, having had the role most recently in 2012.

McCartney was in New York earlier this week for a couple pop-up shows at the Bowery Ballroom. There, his band’s encore was the same as his SNL setlist: “Golden Slumbers,” “Carry That Weight,” and “The End.”",paul

McCartney played an intimate show at the legendary Bowery Ballroom on Feb. 11, with physical tickets only available at the box office. (McCartney’s Instagram post warned fans: “Avoid purchasing tickets from third-party vendors. Fake tickets will not be honored and entry will be denied.”). The show sold out within 30 minutes.

Following that celebratory evening, McCartney announced a second show, taking place on Feb. 12; tickets once again instantly sold out. A third show has since been announced for Feb. 14. Doors will open at 5 p.m. with a 6:30 p.m. start time. Tickets once again are only available at the Bowery Ballroom box office.

The surprise gigs are McCartney’s first shows of 2025, after spending much of last year on the final leg of his Got Back Tour. The run originally launched in 2022 and finally wrapped in December 2024 with a special London show featuring Ringo Starr and Ronnie Wood.

One resolution the musician did have for this year was finishing his next solo album. In a short Q&A with fans on his website, McCartney said that he’s “been working on a lot of songs,” but had to put the album “to the side” to focus on the Got Back Tour. “I’m hoping to get back into that and finish up a lot of these songs,” McCartney wrote. “So, how’s about that? My New Year’s resolution is to finish a new album!”

McCartney’s most recent solo album, McCartney III, arrived in 2020. It was a follow-up of sorts to its two predecessors, 1970’s McCartney, and 1980’s McCartney II, though it directly followed his 2018 solo effort, Egypt Station.

Speaking to the BBC, McCartney warned of the bill that would let tech firms train their AI models on copyrighted works — including music — unless the artists explicitly opted out. The Beatles legend said the change, if approved, could severely impact young artists’ career.

“You get young guys and girls coming up, and they write a beautiful song, and they don’t own it. They don’t have anything to do with it, and anyone who wants can just rip it off,” McCartney told the BBC.

“The truth is, the money’s going somewhere. When it gets on the streaming platforms, somebody’s getting [the money], and it should be the person who created it. It shouldn’t just be some tech giant somewhere. Somebody’s getting paid. Why shouldn’t it be the guy who sat down and wrote ‘Yesterday’?”

In December, artists, publishers, media companies and more banded together to form the Creative Rights in AI Coalition, which aims to keep the current copyright protections in place despite the U.K.’s continued courtship of AI technology (and not the kind of AI that McCartney himself employed on the Beatles’ “Now and Then”).

“We’re the people, you’re the government. You’re supposed to protect us. That’s your job,” McCartney said to lawmakers in the interview. “So if you’re putting through a bill, make sure you protect the creative thinkers, the creative artists, or you’re not gonna have them. If there’s such a thing as a government, it’s their responsibility — I would think — to protect young people to try and enhance that whole thing so it works. So that these people have got job and can enhance the world with wonderful art.”

Tom Kiehl, chief executive of music industry body UK Music, told the BBC, “Government plans to change copyright law to make it easier for AI firms to use the music of artists, composers and music companies without their permission put the music industry at a huge risk.”",paul

McCartney played a spontaneous gig at the Bowery Ballroom, a beloved rock bar on the Lower East Side that holds only 575 people. He was presumably warming up to play the Saturday Night Live anniversary this weekend. But he blew the minds of a few hundred shocked but lucky fans, none of whom woke up that day imagining they might be in store for a McCartney show. “I can’t believe we’re here doing this,” he said with a grin. “But we are. We are here. Doing this.”

Everybody in the room was having the night of our lives — but nobody was having more fun than Paul. He always thrives in a smaller venue, but he made Bowery feel like a cellar full of noise, like the Cavern Club where the Beatles played their early Liverpool gigs. Early on, when a fan yelled, “Billy Shears!” Paul replied, “You are!”

McCartney just announced the gig at noon on Tuesday, with the warning that tickets were available only at the venue — first come, first serve. Fans were grabbing coats and literally running through the streets of lower Manhattan — one fan said it was like seeing the opening chase in A Hard Day’s Night, except instead of teenagers, it was mobs of middle-aged people dashing through the city streets. Sixty years later, Paul inspires that same kind of hysteria. See how they run. (He added to the surprise on Wednesday morning by announcing a second show at the same venue.)

In the hours before the venue opened its doors at 5 p.m., the sidewalk was full of fans, some of whom snagged a ticket in time ($50 — talk about value for money) or just hoped to get lucky, with strangers trading our Paul stories or our crazed theories about what surprises or guests he might have in store. But there were no special guests — just Paul, all boyish energy and vigor at 82, with the magnificent four-man band he’s fronted for the past three decades, ripping through nearly two hours of one classic after another. “We just had one day’s rehearsal, yesterday,” he told the crowd. “We usually rehearse more than that, but we just don’t care.” Editor’s picks

The whole night had that impulsive “Suddenly I see you, did I tell you I need you” energy. He kicked off with “A Hard Day’s Night,” then mixed up hits — “Blackbird,” “Jet,” “Let It Be,” “Maybe I’m Amazed” — with left-field delights like “Mrs. Vanderbilt.” He did a surprisingly hearty “Come on to Me,” from his superb 2018 Egypt Station, a pick nobody saw coming. The three-man Hot City Horns joined for jams like “Got to Get You Into My Life,” “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,” and the dusty Wings groove “Letting Go.”

The crowd up front was packed with young women, a fact that Paul did not fail to notice, as they screamed, danced, and did we’re-not-worthy bows. It is a fact universally acknowledged that Paul gains superhuman powers from being in a room full of female energy. “OK, let’s get this out of the way,” he said at his psychedelic-painted piano. “Girls, give me a Beatles scream.” The room exploded, as Paul drank in every last drop of those screams, admitting, “I can’t resist!”

The room was full of rowdy punters yelling for obscure faves from his solo catalog, like “Calico Skies” and “Ram On.” Paul laughed out loud when one fan called out for “Flying to My Home.” “There’s always old folks looking for deep cuts!” he said. He told a great story about listening to the Sirius Beatles channel in his car and hearing a tune he fancied. “I made the driver turn it up,” Paul marveled. “He said it was a song called ‘Sweet Sweet Memories’ and I said, ‘I don’t remember that at all!’” It’s a 1993 outtake from Off the Ground. “He said it was a B side to a CD single! Do they even have B sides, CD singles? Maybe they do.” Related Content

He sat at the piano for a beautiful “My Valentine,” for his wife, Nancy, recalling how he wrote it on their first trip to Morocco. As my Rolling Stone colleague Angie Martoccio pointed out, this night happened to be the 60th anniversary of Ringo Starr’s wedding to Maureen Cox. (Paul didn’t mention it, but maybe that’s why it felt like Mo was there in spirit for “Get Back.”)

The high point? You mean besides “Blackbird”? The 1968 White Album gem has been at the heart of his live show for nearly 25 years, just Paul and his acoustic guitar. When he asked if we’d heard the story of how he wrote the song, everyone yelled yes, but he naturally shrugged, “I’m gonna tell it anyway,” a beautifully typical Macca moment. He recalled the Beatles’ arrival in the U.S. in February 1964, their shock at the sight of racism, and their refusal to play a segregated show in Jacksonville, Florida. “We were just kids,” McCartney said. “I’ve got grandchildren older than that now.”

But there was an even huger emotional watershed in store. At the piano, right after drinking in the audience’s “Beatles scream,” McCartney casually began a rare performance of “Now and Then,” the 1977 John demo that he lovingly turned into “Now and Then,” the Beatles’ 2022 farewell single. Hearing Paul sing “Now and Then” in his old friend’s adopted city felt intensely emotional for him as well as the audience. “John had so much love for New York City,” he said. “We love you, John. Let’s hear it for John!”

Playing in New York often seems to conjure up Lennon’s presence for him. (At the Garden a few years ago, he surprised the crowd by saying, “This one is for my mate John,” before casually striking up “A Day in the Life” for the first time that tour.) But there was something especially intimate about this “Now and Then.” Lennon wrote the song alone at the Dakota in NYC, feeling far away from old friends, dreaming of them and singing to them. But of the thousands of people who heard this demo over the years, Paul was the only one who really heard what his oldest friend was trying to express. He spent years on a quest to bring his mate’s unfinished song to life. So it was devastatingly powerful to hear Paul sing “Now and Then” in the city where John wrote it, bringing it all back home. It was a moment that felt intensely private — as if we were eavesdropping on the two of them — yet massive, as he summed up the whole pained story of their friendship in one performance.

It was the American live debut of “Now and Then.“ But 61 years after the Beatles invaded the Big Apple for The Ed Sullivan Show. in February 1964 — in fact, the exact date of the Fabs’ first U.S. concert — Paul made that same magic happen, on a snowy winter night, sometime in New York City. The sense of emotional urgency went deep in moments like “Let Me Roll It” — one of the night’s big crowd-flatteners — when he gave a little extra intensity to the key line, “I want to tell you, and now’s the time.”

Even by Paul’s standards, the whole show was a joyful explosion, full of spontaneous flourishes like the “You were the blasters” quip, which seems to be a new one, with the chemistry of his tight band: Wix Wickens on keyboards, Rusty Anderson, Brian Ray on guitars, and the mighty Abe Laboriel Jr. on drums. The last time McCartney played the New York area, at MetLife Stadium in June 2022, it was the night before his 80th birthday. That night, he sent everyone home with the four words every McCartney fan craves hearing: “See you next time.” He ended this show with the same words, and he made them sound like a statement of purpose. Now’s the time, now and then, now and forever.

Noah Kahan, John Mayer, Vampire Weekend, and Maren Morris are all on the lineup, along with Dead & Company, Rolling Stone has learned. The event is slated for Jan. 31.

It will also feature Zac Brown, Sierra Ferrell, Mick Fleetwood with Stewart Copeland, Dave Matthews, Sammy Hagar, Bruce Hornsby, Norah Jones, Dave Matthews, My Morning Jacket, Billy Strings, the War on Drugs, the War and Treaty, Wynonna Judd, and Dwight Yoakam, RS can confirm, among others. (The Hollywood Reporter was the first to report the lineup.)

Dead & Company’s current lineup includes Grateful Dead members Bob Weir and Mickey Hart, alongside Mayer, Jay Lane, Oteil Burbridge, and Jeff Chimenti. The event will likely honor the Dead’s bassist, Phil Lesh, who died in October at age 85. August 2025 also marks the 30th anniversary of the death of Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead’s lead songwriter and guitarist.

The MusiCares event is one of the few official Grammys parties to remain scheduled after numerous others — including Spotify’s Best New Artist showcase — were canceled to focus efforts on raising money for those affected by the Los Angeles fires. MusiCares, the Academy’s non-profit established to help the music community in times of struggle such as disasters or health care, has already raised $2 million in wildfire relief funds.

Grateful Dead join a long list of previous honorees, including Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, Dolly Parton, Lionel Richie, Smokey Robinson, Carole King, Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney, and Barbra Streisand.

This marks only the third time a band (as opposed to a single artist) has received MusiCares’ annual award, following Fleetwood Mac in 2018 and Aerosmith in 2020. Garcia and Lesh will also be the first people to receive the honor posthumously.

“This honor is truly a testament to the legacy of the music, which has always been bigger than us — it’s about the connection between us, the crew, and all those who’ve been on this long strange trip,” Weir, Lesh, Hart, and Kreutzmann said in a statement just days before Lesh’s death. “It’s not just about what we create, but about making sure the people behind it, behind us every night, the ones who quietly make it all happen, get the support they need to keep going, no matter what life throws at them.”",paul

Dave Grohl, Krist Novoselic, and Pat Smear dissolved Nirvana after Kurt Cobain’s death in 1994, but they came back together in 2012 to record “Cut Me Some Slack” with Paul McCartney. Two years later, when they were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, they performed with St. Vincent, Kim Gordon, Joan Jett, and Lorde. Later that night, they played an extended set at the tiny Brooklyn club St. Vitus. They last took the stage together in 2018 at Cal Jam in San Bernardino, California.

Nearly every time they’ve played since Cobain’s death, a female singer was brought in to sing his words. The idea came to them early in their rehearsals for the Hall of Fame in 2014. “We thought, ‘Wait, it has to be all women,’” Grohl told Rolling Stone that year. “‘Don’t even ask anyone else. If we can fill the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame performance with these incredible women singing Nirvana songs, then we’ll have achieved our own revolution.’ It also added a whole other dimension to the show. It added substance and depth, so it didn’t turn into a eulogy. It was more about the future.”

The initial rehearsals were incredibly emotional. “The first time we played together, it was like seeing a ghost,” Grohl said. “The second time, it was a little more reserved. And the last time we played it was like that fucking Demi Moore/Patrick Swayze pottery wheel scene from Ghost. We usually got the song by the third take. It started to sound like Nirvana. Our road crew and some friends were in the room when we launched into ‘Scentless Apprentice’ for the first time. There were jaws on the floor.”

At the time, they had no idea if they’d ever play together again. “That’s a good question,” Novoselic told Rolling Stone. “I mean, there’s Foo Fighters, and Dave has some other projects going on. And I have some commitments. But you never say never now. We did it. I sure won’t say no. Maybe we can even do some new music one day.”",paul

In a new… [+2052 chars]","Following Paul McCartney’s lead, Elton John called on the U.K. government to impose new rules to protect the copyrights of artists and musicians amidst the rise of artificial intelligence.

In a new interview with The Times, John expressed concern that the “wheels are in motion to allow AI companies to ride roughshod over the traditional copyright laws that protect artists’ livelihoods.”

Specifically, John backed an amendment to a proposed bill (which will be voted on tomorrow, Jan. 28) that would extend existing copyright protections in the U.K. The amendment is part of an an effort to preempt a possible overhaul of U.K. copyright law that would potentially give generative AI companies greater access to copyrighted works by forcing artists and rights holders to actively “opt out” of having their works used.

“This will allow global big tech companies to gain free and easy access to artists’ work in order to train their artificial intelligence and create competing music,” John said. “This will dilute and threaten young artists’ earnings even further. The musician community rejects it wholeheartedly.”

McCartney similarly shared his concerns and frustrations on the matter, saying these new laws would allow AI to “rip off” creators and specifically hinder younger artists. “You get young guys and girls coming up, and they write a beautiful song, and they don’t own it,” McCartney told the BBC. “They don’t have anything to do with it, and anyone who wants can just rip it off.”

John, in his interview, noted that it’s already “harder than ever for new and emerging musicians to make the finances of the industry stack up to sustain a fledgling career, due to challenging financial situations, including the increased costs of touring.” Undercutting the protections that allow artists to profit off their work would only further exacerbate those issues, he argued.

“Without thorough and robust copyright protection that allows artists to earn hard-fought earnings from their music, the UK’s future place on the world stage as a leader in arts and popular culture is under serious jeopardy,” John said. “It is the absolute bedrock of artistic prosperity, and the country’s future success in the creative industries depends on it.”",paul

Aubrey Plaza, who made her first public appearance following the death of her husband Jeff Baena, introduced the performance.

Backed by the Roots, Cyrus and Howard duetted a soulful, gritty rendition of the Prince-penned “Nothing Compares 2 U,” which became a big hit for O’Connor. (Prince also served as an SNL musical guest four times). Their rousing rendition was a fitting tribute to the late singer, who only appeared once on SNL. The song appeared on O’Connor’s 1990 sophomore album, I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got, and the single became a worldwide hit, spending four weeks atop the Billboard Hot 100.

While fans may have wanted O’Connor to perform the megahit during her musical guest appearance in 1992, she instead staged a protest against the Catholic Church, performing Bob Marley’s 1976 track “War” a cappella. She then held up a photograph of Pope John Paul II and proceeded to tear it into pieces. “Fight the real enemy,” she declared as she whipped the pieces to the stage floor.

They ended with the famous line: “Live from New York, it’s Saturday night!” (Yes, it’s Sunday, but totally appropriate given the 50th anniversary celebration its marking).

Daniel McCartney, who works as a talent agent at 33&West, said in an Instagram story on Monday that “effective immediately” he would not be representing West “due to his harmful and hateful remarks that myself nor 33&West can stand for.” (It is unclear when West signed with 33&West.)

A team member from Yeezy also left. West’s one-time chief of staff Eric Cui quit on Sunday, Rolling Stone has learned. It came shortly after West defended Sean “Diddy” Combs for physically abusing his ex-girlfriend Casandra “Cassie” Ventura, posting screenshots of the hotel surveillance video that showed Combs attacking her.

“I loved working at YZY because I believed in your dream,” Cui wrote in a statement posted to Instagram. “I believe in free speech … so I will use my free speech to say that violence and crimes against women and children is wrong.”

West kicked off his tweeting spree on Thursday night, unleashing a stream of vile and offensive posts over the next few days. He later praised and thanked Elon Musk for allowing him “to vent” freely without being kicked off the social media platform.

The tipping point came when West purchased airtime during the Super Bowl on Sunday night, in which he directed viewers to his Yeezy website, where he was selling a $20 white T-shirt that displayed a swastika.

On Tuesday, a Shopify spokesperson confirmed to Rolling Stone the company had pulled down his website for violating its terms. The same day, West was sued by a former Yeezy staffer, who claimed that West targeted and taunted her because she was Jewish.



West deactivated his X (formerly Twitter) account on Monday. “I’m logging out of Twitter,” he wrote. “It has been very cathartic to use the world as a sounding board. It was like an Ayahuasca trip. Love all of you who gave me your energy and attention.”",paul

Grohl was not included in the initial lineup, announced last week, but does appear in a new promo for the special, which will stream live on Peacock. The concert special is executive produced by SNL creator Lorne Michaels and Mark Ronson, and will be hosted by Jimmy Fallon.

The Foo Fighters have been largely out of the public eye since last September, when Grohl confirmed he fathered a child outside of his marriage. He announced the news on Instagram, noting, “I love my wife and my children, and I am doing everything I can to regain their trust and earn their forgiveness. We’re grateful for your consideration toward all the children involved, as we move forward together.”

Shortly after, Foo Fighters dropped off the lineup for Soundside Music Festival in Bridgeport, Connecticut, canceling their set only two days before they were set to headline. The musician has kept a low profile since, waiting until last week’s FireAid concert in Los Angeles to reemerge.

During the charity event, held in two venues, Grohl joined fellow Nirvana members Krist Novoselic and Pat Smear to perform “Breed” with St. Vincent, “School” with Kim Gordon, “Territorial Pissings” with Joan Jett, and “All Apologies” with Violet Grohl, Grohl’s 18-year-old daughter.

Grohl’s inclusion in SNL 50 is fitting as the drummer appeared on the late-night sketch show 15 times between 1992 and 2023, now holding the record for most musical appearances on the show. He has performed nine times with the Foo Fighters and twice with Nirvana, as well as once as a drummer for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and once as a member of Them Crooked Vultures. In addition, the Foo Fighters joined Mick Jagger in 2012, while Grohl and his Nirvana bandmates joined Paul McCartney later that year. Grohl recently appeared in the 50 Years of SNL Music documentary to discuss his relationship with the show.

SNL 50: The Homecoming Concert will feature Lady Gaga, Bad Bunny, Miley Cyrus, Post Malone, Chris Martin, Jelly Roll, David Byrne, Post Malone, Eddie Vedder, Jack White, Brittany Howard, the Roots, Devo, Brandi Carlile, Mumford & Sons, Backstreet Boys, Arcade Fire, the B-52s, and Preservation Hall Jazz Band.

In November, Rolling Stone ranked the 50 best SNL musical performances ahead of the show’s 50th anniversary year. Several of the performers slated for the SNL anniversary concert appear on the list, as does Nirvana.",paul

While Ty did not address West directly, or mention his name, he wrote, “I do not condone ANY form of hate speech towards ANYBODY.”

Ty and West have collaborated frequently over the years and formed the duo, ¥$, in 2023 — a point at which West’s history of antisemitism and making other offensive remarks was well known and documented. In February 2024, ¥$ released their debut album — and first of a reported trilogy — Vultures 1. (The original album cover notably featured art from German painter Casper David Friedrich, whose work was widely beloved by the Nazis, paired with typography that seemed to nod toward Burzum, a Norwegian black metal band fronted by a Nazi sympathizer and convicted murderer. It was eventually replaced.)

While Vultures 2 followed in August 2024, since then there’s been no word on when (or if) the final installment will arrive. A representative for Ty Dolla $ign did not immediately return Rolling Stone‘s request for comment on the status Vultures 3 or if Ty plans to remain a member of ¥$.

West launched his latest tear last week with a posting spree on X, where he spewed a lot of the same kind of antisemitic stuff that previously got him banned from the platform the last time, along with a variety of homophobic, misogynistic, and ableist posts. The posting continued over the weekend, though by this Monday, Feb. 10, it appeared that West had deactivated his account on his own accord.

By then, though, the focus of the controversy had shifted. West purchased airtime during the Super Bowl for a Yeezy commercial, which featured him in a dentist’s chair asking people to go to the company’s website. The one item available was a white T-shirt with a swastika.

Since then, the Yeezy store page has been taken down by Shopify for violating the company’s terms of service. And West has been dropped by his talent agent Daniel McCartney at 33&West.",paul

Fey and Poehler interrupted the host’s monologue, much to his (feigned) surprise, and critiqued his joke telling.

“Trump is banning paper straws and that’s the best you’ve got?” Fey asked. “You think you can do better?” Fallon replied. “Yeah, yeah, we do,” Poehler insisted. The group, joined by Seth Meyers, staged an impromptu joke off, dubbed the “Tonight Show Joke Off,” involving a series of set-ups and a red buzzer.

The joke set-ups involved Kendrick Lamar, paper straws, and Domino’s new pepperoni pizza perfume. There was no one overall winner, but Fey got in a particularly good zinger about Drake.

Later on the late-night show, Fey and Poehler sat down with Fallon to reflect on being part of Saturday Night Live and co-hosting “Weekend Update.” The comedians also teased the SNL50: The Anniversary Special, which will air on NBC and Peacock on Sunday.

During the interview, Fallon asked, “Did you always know you were a great combination?” Fey responded, “It’s been a long time that we’ve been paired, right?”

“Yeah, we’ve been friends for over 30 years and we’ve been together doing stuff a lot,” Poehler said. She added of “Weekend Update,” which Fallon and Fey co-hosted first, “But I’m kind of like Tina’s second wife because you guys did it first and I came in and I got all the second wife goodness. I remember watching you guys do it and thinking, ‘Wow that seems hard, I hope I never have to do that.'”

She joked, “SNL feels to me like college. I would never get into it now.”

Fey and Poehler are heading back out on their ongoing Restless Leg comedy tour on March 29 starting in Florida. The tour will also take them to cities like Detroit, Phoenix, and Las Vegas before culminating with back-to-back shows in New Jersey, including two Atlantic City performances on June 21 and a show the next day in Newark.

SNL50: The Anniversary Special will feature appearances from numerous SNL alums, including Kristen Wiig, Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, Will Ferrell, Fred Armisen, Andy Samberg, and Chevy Chase. The three-hour telecast will also include appearances from musical artists including Bad Bunny, Miley Cyrus, Paul McCartney, Paul Simon, and Sabrina Carpenter, and celebs like Adam Driver, John Mulaney, Kim Kardashian, Martin Short, Pedro Pascal, Robert De Niro, Scarlett Johansson, and Tom Hanks.",paul

The hip-hop legend triumphed in his halftime show at the big game in the New Orleans’ Caesar Superdome, in the middle of a lopsided Super Bowl where the Philadelphia Eagles ethered the Kansas City Chiefs. “The revolution about to be televised,” Lamar warned at the start of his halftime blowout. “You picked the right time but the wrong guy.” This halftime show had everything — Samuel L. Jackson as Uncle Sam, SZA singing, Serena Williams doing a crip walk on the side. But Lamar’s blitz was way more action-packed than the actual game, since all the Chiefs did was sit down and be humble.

Lamar’s equally lopsided beef with Drake was the center of the halftime show — he brilliantly wore a diamond chain around his neck with a lowercase “a,” as in “A minor.” The big drama was “will he or won’t he?” with regard to his biggest hit. Would he do “Not Like Us” and call Drake a pedophile in front of 100 million people? The answer was yes and no — Lamar delivered “Not Like Us,” yet cut the line “certified pedophile.”

But it was 13 minutes of Dot Big Trippin’ all the way. He squabbled up for a medley of hits including “DNA.,” “Euphoria,” “Man at the Garden,” and “Humble.” There were no surprises, nothing fancy, no guests (except the already-expected SZA and Mustard), no attempt at showmanship — Lamar kept it all about the music, with the lights all the way down, accompanied by a crew of dancers in red, white, and blue.

“Salutations!” Samuel L. Jackson announced at the start, dressed up in a top hat. “This is your Uncle Sam. And this is the great American game!” Jackson was a presence all through the set, interrupting during “Squabble Up” to admonish him. “No, no, no!” Jackson yelled. “Too loud, too reckless, too ghetto! Mr. Lamar, do you really know how to play the game? Then tighten up!”

The last time Lamar performed at the Super Bowl, it was the Dr. Dre halftime throwdown of 2022, with Snoop Dogg, Eminem, 50 Cent, Mary J. Blige, and Anderson .Paak on drums. Every star had a spotlight moment — for Lamar, it was “Alright.” It was a fiery political statement in the midst of the NFL’s blatantly racist ban on Colin Kaepernick after he began taking a knee to protest police brutality. Lamar’s line “we hate po-po” got censored, but “Alright” was still a startling moment. Later in the set, Eminem took a knee, an explicit shout-out to the Black Lives Matter movement. But “Alright” was the highlight of a historic halftime.

Editor’s picks

On his own, Lamar stayed away from political statements, pointedly leaving out “Alright.” The controversy was whether he’d go after Aubrey Graham. If there’s any good news for Drake, it’s that he was the co-star of Kendrick’s set without even showing up. He sued Lamar’s label — which is also his own label — over “Not Like Us.” In a statement released ahead of Lamar’s halftime performance, Drake’s lawyers said, “UMG is masquerading as a champion of artistic freedom by calling its actions merely ‘entertainment,’ but there is nothing entertaining about pedophilia or child abuse in the real world.”

Lamar brought his own drama going into the Super Bowl. This is the first time any star has done the halftime show after already releasing a Number One album and complaining that nobody called to congratulate him on getting the Super Bowl gig except Nas. “I’ve always been very open about storytelling through all my catalog and my history of music,” he said last week. “And I’ve always had a passion about bringing that on whatever stage I’m on.”

There was controversy over the fact that hometown hero Lil Wayne didn’t get the gig in New Orleans. “It hurt, it hurt a whole lot,” Weezy stated in an Instagram post. At his Lil Weezyana Fest, he told the crowd, “It was ripped away from me.” Lamar fired back on GNX, in the opening track “Wacced Out Murals”: “Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down.” (In the same verse, he added “Snoop posted ‘Taylor Made,’ I pray it was the edibles” — maybe the same edibles that inspired Snoop’s cringe-strophic anti-bigotry ad with Tom Brady?) Related Content

But he brilliantly milked the tension over “Not Like Us.” Uncle Sam Jackson declared, “Scorekeeper, deduct one life.” Then Lamar consulted with a four-woman team of experts (“Ladies!” “Yes, Dot?”), saying, “I wanna do they favorite song, but they love to sue.” He teased the keyboard riff (“yeah, THAT song”), then switched gears into the cameo for SZA, who joined him to sing “Luther” and “All the Stars.”

“That’s what I’m talking about!” Uncle Sam said. “That’s what America wants. Nice, calm.” But that’s when Dot went into “Not Like Us,” announcing, “It’s a cultural divide.” He pulled back on “pedophile,” which probably made the NFL’s legal team breathe easier, but comically hyped up the big line, “Tryna strike a chord and it’s probably a minor!” (The production team added a glaring “audience sing-along” sound cue for that line — but those are a long tradition at Super Bowl halftime shows, like sitcom laugh tracks, and the audience was mostly inaudlble for the rest of the performance.)

Lamar was the musical highlight of a Super Bowl that had plenty of weird pop-culture moments, like a godawful Mountain Dew commercial with Seal as a CGI seal. The crowd-cams had the sight of Paul McCartney chatting with Adam Sandler, while Kevin Costner made a cute couple in the crowd with Pete Davidson.

Jon Batiste sang a beautiful national anthem, the first performer to accompany himself on piano since Alicia Keys stretched it out into the all-time longest version in 2013. Batiste sang the line “the land of the freeee” three times, as if making it a pointed jab at the current president, who was attending the game. But he still managed to hit the under, a big feat in a year when the over/under line for the national anthem has become one of the Super Bowl’s most popular prop bets.

Taylor Swift spent the game in a box with the Haim sisters and Ice Spice, loyally watching her team go down to defeat, in a down-home Daisy Dukes outfit. She was wearing a certain Chief’s initial chain ‘round her neck, chain ‘round her neck, as opposed to her upper thigh, where she wore the same chain to the Grammys a week ago. Really, Swift should have rushed down to the field to play QB for the Chiefs, since she did a better job of preparing for the big game. But make no mistake, it was Lamar’s night all the way. As Uncle Jam put it, this is the great American game — not just football, but hip-hop.

It’s a Funked-Up Look at Genius,Profile of the man behind Sly and the Family Stone gives you plenty of evidence that he's one of the most important musicians ever — and a lot more.,http://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-reviews/sly-lives-review-questlove-sly-stone-documentary-1235233910/,https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-139836933.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1,2025-01-24T06:45:00Z,"The song titles alone evoke a sense of joy, excitement, community: “Dance to the Music,” “Stand!”, “Everyday People,” “Sing a Simple Song,” “I Want to Take You Higher,” “Hot Fun in the Summertime,” “… [+6264 chars]","The song titles alone evoke a sense of joy, excitement, community: “Dance to the Music,” “Stand!”, “Everyday People,” “Sing a Simple Song,” “I Want to Take You Higher,” “Hot Fun in the Summertime,” “Thank You (Falettinme Be Mice Elf Agin),” “Everybody Is a Star.” (That last one was also the headline of its creator’s Rolling Stone cover story.) You know every one of these tracks. Trust us. If you’re not automatically singing their hooks — “Diff-rent/Strokes!/For diff-rent/Folks!” or “I-I-I-I/Love Ev-ery-day/People!” — or humming their melodies while reading the above list, then you’d recognize the band’s beats and grooves sampled by several generations of R&B and hip-hop innovators. Sly and the Family Stone were a multi-ethnic, multi-gender, multi-genre group when such concepts still seemed impossibly utopian on both the charts and the streets, led by a songwriter who deserved to be mentioned in the same breath as Mozart, Miles and McCartney. He was born Sylvester Stewart, adopted the name Sly Stone, revolutionized music several times over, and eventually became defined more by his absences than his stage presence.

Sly Lives!, Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson’s documentary on the good life and hard times of a frontman and Family man that opened the Sundance Film Festival, wants to connect some dots for you. Yes, this profile of Stone covers everything from his stint as a radio personality in early ’60s San Francisco (KSOL, 1450 on your AM dial) to leading a collective that’d nearly steal Woodstock away from their rock & roll peers to, well, everything that happened after 1974. And like Thompson’s invaluable Summer of Soul (2021), which features the Family Stone’s red-hot performance at the 1969 Harlem Cultural Fair, it’s filled with clips of the band at their peak that double as funk-fueled testimonials. Should you somehow still doubt that they were groundbreaking, a dozen or so talking heads can attest in detail to the exact acres of ground they broke. It’s a music doc that takes its music-doc responsibilities seriously. Editor’s picks

But pay attention to the movie’s title, as well as the “a.k.a.” that follows it. Sly Lives! — that exclamation point is earned — knows it doesn’t need to sell you on dancin’ to the music. Yet Questlove & co. would like to put the complete story of the man behind it in context, as well as rescuing him from a narrative that puts its emphasis on the past few erratic decades. The “lives” part isn’t used lightly here, and speaks less to the fact that he’s still around in his 80s and more about the continual vibrancy of an overshadowed legacy. Sly the Slippery Recluse, known for blowing off gigs and and cracked public appearances, gets more ink than the six years between 1967 and 1973. Sly the Once-in-a-Generation Artist too often gets short shrift. (Even the memoir, published last year on Thompson’s literary imprint, feels slightly lopsided.) This doc sets the scales straight. It favors the albums themselves over the criminal record.

Not that it doesn’t peer directly into the There’s a Riot Going On-era of darkness — “Family Affair” may have that buoyant chorus, but take another listen to those lyrics — and the subtitle “The Burden of Black Genius” lets you know Questlove is after bigger game here. Having reached the sort of popularity that goes beyond crossover status and into the realm of the iconic, Stone is peaking when he decides to move operations from the Bay Area to Los Angeles. He’s also starting to buckle under the pressure, some of which come from his own self-sabotaging behavior, and others which comes from having to represent on a whole new stage. “There’s no blueprint for what comes next,” notes author and academic Mark Anthony Neal about Stone’s post-Woodstock moment. “There is no Black Elvis.”

Which gives Questlove the opportunity to pose a question. Stone was the first artist in his estimation to suffer the burden of having to do what he did while carrying a lot of baggage, at a level virtually unprecedented from other Black musicians of the day. Using that as a starting point, how does one define Black genius? He asks a version of this to D’Angelo, Q-Tip, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Nile Rogers, Chaka Khan, George Clinton, Vernon Reid and a number of other folks who are more than equipped to weigh in on the matter, but the doc cuts away before they answer. The one person who does get a chance to respond in the moment is André 3000, who counters “Do you believe in the concept of Black genius” with “I love it when it happens.” Related Content

It’s a great way of both framing Sly’s accomplishments and, more importantly, reframing all of what he went through — and if anything, you wish Questlove leaned more into this concept from the POVs of others who have been blessed and burdened with the tag. Such grist for the chinstroking mill might have been better served outside of a single-subject profile doc, even as it enhances that very same doc; we’d watch a whole six-part series on the conversations that took place with the canon of fellow musical geniuses who get grilled here. The musical lessons they and too many others to count took from Sly are self-evident — more than one person echoes the sentiment that with no Sly and the Family Stone, there is no Prince and the Revolution. What did Sly’s flameout teach them? How did him becoming Black Elvis lead the way for others to walk their own pitfall-laden path?

Sly Lives! isn’t built to answer those queries, just to offer them up. It’s better set up to offer a treasure trove of insights and the opportunity to hear “Everyday People” evolve take after take. Knock-you-on-your-ass quotes are puchased in bulk: how “Stand!” builds to a “musical orgasm” (Jimmy Jam); how that album “was The Chronic for my parents’ generation” (Dream Hampton); how Sly may have been “higher than Georgia pine” on his Dick Cavett Show appearance, yet still beat the host at his smarty-pants game; and how Stone was “bringing people together at a time when this country was tearing itself apart” (Vernon Reid). The one that arguably sticks with you the most, however, belongs to Family Stone saxophonist Jerry Martini. “I was a white man trying to be Black,” he says. “[Sly] was a Black man trying to be everything.” The latter succeeded. It nearly killed him. But it also produced music that lives to this day. Questlove’s movie gives you both. For that, we echo our own Sly favorite’s title back to him: “Thank You.”",paul

Lynch was 66 years old at the time. He was handsome and sharply dressed in his uniform: blazer, white shirt, American Spirits in his breast pocket, white hair, swooped in a faux-hawk. It was 100 degrees outside, the radio murmured from the speakers, and the air conditioning was doing its best.

Beyond the tinted windows, Los Angeles floated by — blue skies all around. I was interviewing Lynch for a piece in The New York Times Magazine about his recent emergence as an evangelist for the practice of Transcendental Meditation. I’d interviewed Lynch a number of times over the years and despite the journalistic imperative of objectivity, it was hard not to love him. He was so solidly original and clear, with his crisp nasal twang, his sharp observations about the world. That day, he was a bit grumpy — he was on a cleanse, he explained, and his wife, Emily, was about to have a baby, too. But there was something about our conversation that felt high-stakes — almost life or death. I’ve been circling it ever since.

Facing each other as we made our way through Hollywood, we were talking about why he had taken this late-in-life turn, after decades as a beloved and critically acclaimed filmmaker, to such an intense focus on Transcendental Meditation. Lynch had learned T.M. in the early 1970s, part of a huge wave of Americans who adopted the technique popularized by the Beatles’ Indian guru, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. “I’ve told this story a million times. OK, Claire,” he said to me in the limo, carefully enunciating. “I was in the room with the teacher and I got my mantra. She said, ‘OK, you sit comfortably in this chair, close the eyes, do as I taught you, start the mantra. I’ll be back in 20 minutes.’ So I sat comfortably in the chair, closed my eyes, started the mantra. As I’ve said many times before, it was as if I was in an elevator and they cut the cables. Within I went. And boom. I was in so much bliss, I couldn’t believe it. I thought, ‘Where has this experience been? This is beyond the beyond.’” He began to practice twice a day, never missing a session. Editor’s picks

Lynch saw Transcendental Meditation as fundamental to his survival as an artist in Hollywood. “In 1984, my film Dune was released, and meditation saved my life,” he said matter-of-factly. “Because if I hadn’t been meditating, I probably would’ve committed suicide. I didn’t have final cut on Dune. It was released and it got terrible reviews and it didn’t make a nickel. So I died the death twice. I didn’t make the film I wanted to make, because I didn’t have final cut. Meditation really saved me. If you have that happiness built up inside, you can withstand some heavy things. And if you don’t, they’ll knock you down.”

For decades, Lynch said, meditation was a private thing for him. He would leave the set and quietly excuse himself, “diving within,” as he called it. If people asked him about it, he would share his experience and sometimes even pay for a friend to learn. But otherwise he forged his own path. He built a life for himself in Los Angeles, where he made strange and amazing movies and television, recorded music, took photographs, made paintings. He got married and divorced, a few times. He had children. He drank red wine and smoked his cigarettes.

But something changed, he said, in 2002, when he traveled to Europe for an exclusive and expensive experience: the Enlightenment Course. Maharishi, who had barely been seen in public for years, was offering select, longtime meditators the chance to pay a million dollars to spend a month with him — with the promise of a new consciousness. Lynch took the leap and went to the Netherlands. He had just finished filming Mulholland Drive, he told me, and he thought, “I could swing this.”

Initially, he was disappointed when he learned that Maharishi would not be with him physically, instead communicating with the small group via teleconference from his quarters upstairs. Still, like all things Maharishi did, Lynch says, his absence made sense. “When I play it back in my mind, he was right there,” he said. “It’s a strange thing. He was right above us but came through the television. But it was as if there was no television. And that’s the way it was.” It sounded to me like the premise of a David Lynch movie — waiting downstairs for enlightenment while watching a guru on a television. But for Lynch, the time with Maharishi was transformative. He left with a new sense of purpose: He wanted to help the world meditate. “That month was extremely blissful,” he told me. “And I wouldn’t have given it up for anything. But at the same time, when I left there, I did not care one bit about enlightenment. I just loved the people. I didn’t care if I got enlightened or not. I was just a different person when I came back.” Related Content

After the Enlightenment Course, Lynch began to spend much of his time trying to help as many people as possible learn Transcendental Meditation. To that end, in 2005, he started the David Lynch Foundation for Consciousness-Based Education and World Peace. The foundation held star-studded fundraisers, and young Hollywood began coming to Lynch’s house for meditation sessions. With Lynch’s advocacy, hundreds of thousands of children learned to meditate. But he was equally powerful in bringing celebrities to T.M. Because of Lynch, celebrities such as Hugh Jackman, Steve Martin, Tom Hanks, Katy Perry, Lady Gaga, Oprah Winfrey, and Ellen DeGeneres all learned the technique. He also recruited back longtime meditators such as Jerry Seinfeld, Paul McCartney, and Ringo Starr to help raise money to teach meditation.

Lynch began to travel the globe, speaking out about his practice of T.M. and its positive benefits. He wrote a book, Catching the Big Fish: Meditation, Consciousness, and Creativity, and participated in several documentaries that followed him as he spoke to film students in Estonia, Brazil, Ukraine, and other places on the topic. The results of his efforts were significant: Over the past 20 years, according to David Lynch Foundation CEO Bobby Roth, the organization has raised over $100 million, taught more than a million people to meditate, and instituted meditation programs in schools and hospitals around the world. “I think he was responsible for more people learning T.M. than any other figure since Maharishi,” says Roth, an author and a teacher of T.M. for the past 53 years, who has run the foundation since its inception. “That’s his legacy. He wasn’t just an actor who put his name on something, some cause. He went everywhere, he traveled around the world, worked long hours and weeks and months. We would be nowhere without David Lynch and his energy and his focus and his conviction.”

But that day back in 2012, Lynch paused his story about meditation and world transformation and stared at me. “Now, Claire,” Lynch said, his bright blue eyes suddenly focused intently on me. “When I first met you, I felt that you had doubts. Is that a real feeling?” I winced when Lynch said this. While I wanted to just go with him on all of this, he had put his finger on something fundamentally true about me: I was a doubter.

While everything Lynch was describing sounded straightforward and so obviously good, I had some baggage around the subject. I had spent my childhood living at the center of what was then called the Movement — the Transcendental Meditation Movement — in rural Iowa in the 1980s. Those were strange years — I lived on the campus of the Maharishi International University, and I attended the Maharishi School of the Age of Enlightenment. Much of our learning was focused on Maharishi’s philosophy about how the world worked and how one could attain elevated states of consciousness and enlightenment through the practice of his meditation techniques. We all understood that Maharishi’s way of being in the world was better, more elevated. Together with our parents and teachers, we spent our days and nights living in accordance with the vision of our guru. He wasn’t even around — he lived, Oz-like, in a compound in Europe, and I never met him. In his absence, our world got a little strange and insular.

At school, administrators asked us to emulate Maharishi in every aspect. Negative thinking was a no-no. Inside the halls of the Maharishi School, a recurring refrain to me was, “Claire, can you think of how to say that as a positive?” I often couldn’t. By the time I was a teenager, in the early Nineties, my identity was formed in contradiction to all that was spiritual and striving. One of my most powerful sources of inspiration and rebellion was a steady diet of film and music that my community disapproved of — and as a part of that program, I was obsessed with David Lynch. As a teenager, I watched all his movies and was mesmerized by his dark world, and the idea that the subconscious could be turned into art, not just meditated away. Through his films, Lynch helped shape my idea of what art could be and the importance of exploring our shadows. So you can imagine my surprise when, a decade after I moved away from Iowa, this childhood hero of mine became a spokesperson of sorts for this wonderful thing called Transcendental Meditation.

As we sat in that car a dozen years ago, Lynch and I went back and forth about what his role had become. He said he was just a messenger, but I pushed him. “It could be argued that you are the T.M. movement. WTF, David?” I said, hoping to lighten the mood. He laughed, but he was fed up with me, and my persnickety focus on the past, the cultural weirdness that had happened in the 1980s, and my perception of parts of the Movement as cultish. He didn’t like this. “Old news,” he told me when I first brought up questions about religiosity and T.M. “Total bullshit.”

“Like I told you,” he said, testily, “I love Maharishi. I love what he taught. If you’re part of the Movement, you’re on some salary or whatever. I’m not part of the Movement in that way. But I am 100 percent for Maharishi and his programs. The most important thing to me is the technique. That’s the thing. And without that, it just is totally meaningless. It’s just, like, an intellectual thing. But the technique showed me that peace and happiness and all these positive things are really possible. They really do exist within.”

We both left that car ride exhausted, not quite seeing each other’s point of view. My article on Lynch came out the following spring. He hated it. Roth called me that day and said that Lynch was deeply hurt — that he’d had trouble making it past a sub-headline, inserted by a copy editor at the last minute, that took a shot at the filmmaker for not having made a movie in a long time. I was disappointed about that. I wouldn’t have chosen that headline and didn’t like being a bad thing that happened to David Lynch.

Lynch and I never spoke after that article. He went on to make Twin Peaks: The Return and to continue to work on music and art. I wrote a book about the Transcendental Meditation Movement and raised my two daughters. Weirdly, I became friends with Lynch’s wife Emily and watched our daughters play together. As time passed, and I felt farther away from the strange, insular world of the Movement in the 1980s, I could see more clearly the truth of what Lynch had said that day in the car: Who cares about the past if you’re having a good experience? For me, meditation was a simple and effective practice that helped me navigate the world better. Last summer, as my family was going through a stressful transition, I took my now-teenage daughters down to the David Lynch Foundation offices near New York’s Grand Central Station, where Bobby Roth taught them both their adult mantras. Neither of them are particularly regular in their practice, and they tease me about having grown up in a cult. I get annoyed by this, ironically. But I know at some point they will have the tool if they need it. As Lynch said to me, “Hello, it works.”

The list, which includes over 300 titles, includes an official release of Post Malone’s Nirvana covers, which he performed on a livestream in 2020 during the pandemic. Pressed on vinyl for the first time, Post Malone Tribute To Nirvana features Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker, guitarist Nick Mack, and bassist Brian Lee.

In addition, “Fortnight,” Malone’s collaboration with Taylor Swift, will be released on exclusive 7″ white vinyl.

Several notable live albums will be released, from Gracie Abrams‘ Live From Radio City Music Hall to MJ Lenderman’s And The Wind (Live and Loose!) to Joni Mitchell’s Live 1976 — a 3-LP set culled from last year’s Archives, Vol. 4: The Asylum Years (1976-1980) – to Power To The People – Live At The One To One Concert, New York City, 1972, a four-song EP featuring tracks from John Lennon’s only post-Beatles solo concert.

To coincide with their highly-anticipated reunion, Oasis will drop Time Flies…1994 – 2009, their complete collection of singles released on vinyl for the first time since 2010. Waxahatchee will release two Tigers Blood bonus tracks (“Much Ado About Nothing” and “Mud“) as a 7” single, while the Killers will unleash their three-song set with Bruce Springsteen from Madison Square Garden in October 2022.

Other highlights include U2 and Brian Eno’s 30th anniversary release of Passengers’ Original Soundtracks 1 and Wu-Tang and Mathematics’ Black Samson, The Bastard Swordsman: Wu-Tang, The Saga Continues Collection. The latter is a numbered, limited-edition 2-LP set, and every album jacket features unique “1 of 1” cover art. Check out the full list of releases on Record Store Day’s website.

“Record Store Day is so important, and I really hope to do my part to keep it alive,” Malone said last month, when the event named him ambassador. “We love hitting local shops when we’re on the road, seeing all the crazy artwork… the whole energy in a record store is just super inspiring. I feel at home. It’s really an unexplainable feeling to hit up a shop and dig through crates, just see what grabs your eye. You can be looking for something super specific and end up finding something totally different. It’s the best. Keep supporting y’all and let’s keep records and these local shops going strong.”",john

McCartney played a spontaneous gig at the Bowery Ballroom, a beloved rock bar on the Lower East Side that holds only 575 people. He was presumably warming up to play the Saturday Night Live anniversary this weekend. But he blew the minds of a few hundred shocked but lucky fans, none of whom woke up that day imagining they might be in store for a McCartney show. “I can’t believe we’re here doing this,” he said with a grin. “But we are. We are here. Doing this.”

Everybody in the room was having the night of our lives — but nobody was having more fun than Paul. He always thrives in a smaller venue, but he made Bowery feel like a cellar full of noise, like the Cavern Club where the Beatles played their early Liverpool gigs. Early on, when a fan yelled, “Billy Shears!” Paul replied, “You are!”

McCartney just announced the gig at noon on Tuesday, with the warning that tickets were available only at the venue — first come, first serve. Fans were grabbing coats and literally running through the streets of lower Manhattan — one fan said it was like seeing the opening chase in A Hard Day’s Night, except instead of teenagers, it was mobs of middle-aged people dashing through the city streets. Sixty years later, Paul inspires that same kind of hysteria. See how they run. (He added to the surprise on Wednesday morning by announcing a second show at the same venue.)

In the hours before the venue opened its doors at 5 p.m., the sidewalk was full of fans, some of whom snagged a ticket in time ($50 — talk about value for money) or just hoped to get lucky, with strangers trading our Paul stories or our crazed theories about what surprises or guests he might have in store. But there were no special guests — just Paul, all boyish energy and vigor at 82, with the magnificent four-man band he’s fronted for the past three decades, ripping through nearly two hours of one classic after another. “We just had one day’s rehearsal, yesterday,” he told the crowd. “We usually rehearse more than that, but we just don’t care.” Editor’s picks

The whole night had that impulsive “Suddenly I see you, did I tell you I need you” energy. He kicked off with “A Hard Day’s Night,” then mixed up hits — “Blackbird,” “Jet,” “Let It Be,” “Maybe I’m Amazed” — with left-field delights like “Mrs. Vanderbilt.” He did a surprisingly hearty “Come on to Me,” from his superb 2018 Egypt Station, a pick nobody saw coming. The three-man Hot City Horns joined for jams like “Got to Get You Into My Life,” “Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,” and the dusty Wings groove “Letting Go.”

The crowd up front was packed with young women, a fact that Paul did not fail to notice, as they screamed, danced, and did we’re-not-worthy bows. It is a fact universally acknowledged that Paul gains superhuman powers from being in a room full of female energy. “OK, let’s get this out of the way,” he said at his psychedelic-painted piano. “Girls, give me a Beatles scream.” The room exploded, as Paul drank in every last drop of those screams, admitting, “I can’t resist!”

The room was full of rowdy punters yelling for obscure faves from his solo catalog, like “Calico Skies” and “Ram On.” Paul laughed out loud when one fan called out for “Flying to My Home.” “There’s always old folks looking for deep cuts!” he said. He told a great story about listening to the Sirius Beatles channel in his car and hearing a tune he fancied. “I made the driver turn it up,” Paul marveled. “He said it was a song called ‘Sweet Sweet Memories’ and I said, ‘I don’t remember that at all!’” It’s a 1993 outtake from Off the Ground. “He said it was a B side to a CD single! Do they even have B sides, CD singles? Maybe they do.” Related Content

He sat at the piano for a beautiful “My Valentine,” for his wife, Nancy, recalling how he wrote it on their first trip to Morocco. As my Rolling Stone colleague Angie Martoccio pointed out, this night happened to be the 60th anniversary of Ringo Starr’s wedding to Maureen Cox. (Paul didn’t mention it, but maybe that’s why it felt like Mo was there in spirit for “Get Back.”)

The high point? You mean besides “Blackbird”? The 1968 White Album gem has been at the heart of his live show for nearly 25 years, just Paul and his acoustic guitar. When he asked if we’d heard the story of how he wrote the song, everyone yelled yes, but he naturally shrugged, “I’m gonna tell it anyway,” a beautifully typical Macca moment. He recalled the Beatles’ arrival in the U.S. in February 1964, their shock at the sight of racism, and their refusal to play a segregated show in Jacksonville, Florida. “We were just kids,” McCartney said. “I’ve got grandchildren older than that now.”

But there was an even huger emotional watershed in store. At the piano, right after drinking in the audience’s “Beatles scream,” McCartney casually began a rare performance of “Now and Then,” the 1977 John demo that he lovingly turned into “Now and Then,” the Beatles’ 2022 farewell single. Hearing Paul sing “Now and Then” in his old friend’s adopted city felt intensely emotional for him as well as the audience. “John had so much love for New York City,” he said. “We love you, John. Let’s hear it for John!”

Playing in New York often seems to conjure up Lennon’s presence for him. (At the Garden a few years ago, he surprised the crowd by saying, “This one is for my mate John,” before casually striking up “A Day in the Life” for the first time that tour.) But there was something especially intimate about this “Now and Then.” Lennon wrote the song alone at the Dakota in NYC, feeling far away from old friends, dreaming of them and singing to them. But of the thousands of people who heard this demo over the years, Paul was the only one who really heard what his oldest friend was trying to express. He spent years on a quest to bring his mate’s unfinished song to life. So it was devastatingly powerful to hear Paul sing “Now and Then” in the city where John wrote it, bringing it all back home. It was a moment that felt intensely private — as if we were eavesdropping on the two of them — yet massive, as he summed up the whole pained story of their friendship in one performance.

It was the American live debut of “Now and Then.“ But 61 years after the Beatles invaded the Big Apple for The Ed Sullivan Show. in February 1964 — in fact, the exact date of the Fabs’ first U.S. concert — Paul made that same magic happen, on a snowy winter night, sometime in New York City. The sense of emotional urgency went deep in moments like “Let Me Roll It” — one of the night’s big crowd-flatteners — when he gave a little extra intensity to the key line, “I want to tell you, and now’s the time.”

Even by Paul’s standards, the whole show was a joyful explosion, full of spontaneous flourishes like the “You were the blasters” quip, which seems to be a new one, with the chemistry of his tight band: Wix Wickens on keyboards, Rusty Anderson, Brian Ray on guitars, and the mighty Abe Laboriel Jr. on drums. The last time McCartney played the New York area, at MetLife Stadium in June 2022, it was the night before his 80th birthday. That night, he sent everyone home with the four words every McCartney fan craves hearing: “See you next time.” He ended this show with the same words, and he made them sound like a statement of purpose. Now’s the time, now and then, now and forever.

Epstein has … [+2916 chars]","If any backstage pop institution deserves a biopic of his or her own, it would be Brian Epstein, the Beatles’ tragic manager, champion, and supporter through rough and giddy times alike. Epstein has been portrayed here and there in films, but Midas Man (available on streaming services starting today) is the first full feature devoted to him. According to a report in Variety, the making of the film was fraught, encompassing multiple directors, distribution issues, and a bigger budget than expected. But in light of music-biopic mania and the ongoing fascination with Epstein’s former clients, the belated timing couldn’t be better, which only makes it a shame that the film is largely a competent but uninspiring telling of his tale.

As subjects for biopic treatment go, Epstein’s life is, of course, a natural. The story of a gay, Jewish record-store manager who stumbles upon the young Beatles at the Cavern Club and soon becomes their overseer, while battling his own insecurities and demons before dying of an accidental overdose at 32, was born to be a movie. With Jacob Fortune-Lloyd in the lead role, Midas Man checks off all the appropriate boxes in re-creating Epstein’s life. We see his amazement during that first sighting at the Cavern Club, his tentative initial meeting with the band in their dressing room, the one-after-another meetings in which clueless British-label heads turned down the Beatles, and Epstein’s wheeling and dealing, including a re-creation of his meeting with Ed Sullivan (Jay Leno, who makes the TV host seem like a surly mobster).

For newcomers to the Beatles, the story — especially the way Epstein lived in fear of society’s (and his family)’s disapproval over his gay lifestyle — will surely be eye-opening given these every different and more enlightened times. Although he resembles a middle-aged Harry Styles more than he does Epstein, Fortune-Lloyd captures the mix of prim determination and repressed pain in Epstein’s demeanor. The movie doesn’t mention the trip that Epstein and John Lennon took to Spain in 1963, which resulted in rumors about a possible sexual encounter between the two. But Midas Man does touch upon the tension between the two, and it doesn’t shy away from Epstein’s growing addiction to pills, his back-alley sexual encounters, and at least one case of blackmail that resulted from them.

Editor’s picks

For Beatlemaniacs, though, little if any of this will be breaking news, and the film’s often dreary look (and the absence of any Beatles music, since the producers weren’t able to get those rights) hobble Midas Man as much as its decline-by-numbers narrative. The actors who portray the Beatles aren’t given much to do other than make cheeky remarks to Epstein. (Amusingly, Epstein’s father is played by Eddie Marsan, who played Amy Winehouse’s long-suffering dad in Back to Black — talk about typecasting.) A few fresh angles — like the moments Epstein breaks the fourth wall and addresses us directly on the plot — can’t quite compensate for the movie’s conventionality. Midas Man gently weeps for Epstein, and rightly so, but leaves his story largely earthbound.",john
