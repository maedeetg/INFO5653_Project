Lennon,Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe Pools of sorrow waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind Possessing and caressing me Jai Guru Deva Om Nothing s gonna change my world Nothing s gonna change my world Nothing s gonna change my world Nothing s gonna change my world Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes They call me on and on across the universe Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe Jai Guru Deva Om Nothing s gonna change my world Nothing s gonna change my world Nothing s gonna change my world Nothing s gonna change my world Sounds of laughter shades of life are ringing through my open ears Inciting and inviting me Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns It calls me on and on across the universe Jai Guru Deva Om Nothing s gonna change my world Nothing s gonna change my world Nothing s gonna change my world Nothing s gonna change my world Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva Jai Guru Deva

McCartney,In Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs Of every head he s had the pleasure to have known And all the people that come and go Stop and say hello On the corner is a banker with a motorcar The little children laugh at him behind his back And the banker never wears a mac In the pouring rain very strange Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen He likes to keep his fire engine clean It s a clean machine Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes Four of fish and finger pies In summer meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray And though she feels as if she s in a play She is anyway In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim And then the fireman rushes in From the pouring rain very strange Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit and meanwhile back Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes There beneath the blue suburban skies Penny Lane

McCartney,Wednesday morning at five o clock as the day begins Silently closing her bedroom door Leaving the note that she hoped would say more She goes downstairs to the kitchen Clutching her handkerchief Quietly turning the backdoor key Stepping outside she is free She Is leaving Home She s leaving home after living alone For so many years Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown Picks up the letter that s lying there Standing alone at the top of the stairs She breaks down and cries to her husband Daddy our baby s gone Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly How could she do this to me She Is leaving Home She s leaving home after living alone For so many years Friday morning at nine o clock she is far away Waiting to keep the appointment she made Meeting a man from the motor trade She Is having Fun Something inside that was always denied For so many years She s leaving home
