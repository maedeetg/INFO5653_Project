Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Met her walking down a uptown street
She's so fine you know I wished she was mine
I get shook up every time we meet
I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Come on, give me a clue
I'm just trying to get a message to you, woah
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
She's right here by my side
Lovely indeed, that's why I asked her if she
And she's now promised she will be my bride
I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Come on, give me clues
I'm just trying to get a message to you
I'm just a fool
Oh
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know
Let me tell ya now, she looks so good
Lovely indeed, that's why I asked her if she
Said, "You oughta be in Hollywood"
I'm talkin' 'bout you
Nobody but you
Come on and give me clues
I'm just trying to get a message to you, woah
