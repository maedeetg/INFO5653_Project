Oh, yes, wait a minute, Mister Postman
Wait, Mister Postman
Oh, yeah!
Please, please, Mister Postman
Oh, yeah!
There must be some word someday
From my girlfriend so far away
Please, Mister Postman, look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me
I've been standin' here waitin', Mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returnin' home to me
Please, Mister Postman!
Oh, yeah!
Please, please, Mister Postman
Oh, yeah!
So many days, you passed me by
See the tear standin' in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leavin' me a card or a letter
Mister Postman!
Is there a letter, 
oh, yeah,
 for me?
I've been waitin'
 such a 
long time
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine
You gotta wait
 a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah! 
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah! 
You gotta
 wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah! 
Check it and see one more time for me
You gotta
 wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah! 
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah!
 
Mister Postman
 
Oh, yeah
 
Deliver the letter, the sooner the better
You gotta
 wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah!
 
Wait a minute, wait a minute
Ooh! 
 
You gotta
 wait a minute, wait a minute
Oh, yeah!
 
Gotta wait a minute, wait a minute!
Aah!  You gotta wait, wait a minute
