One, two, three, four
I look at you all
See the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
The problems you sow
Are the troubles you're reaping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world
And I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake
We must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look at the trouble
And pain that is raging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here
Doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps
Gently weeps
Still my guitar gently weeps
