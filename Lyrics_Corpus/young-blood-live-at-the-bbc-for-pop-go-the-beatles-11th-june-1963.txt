I am he
As you are he
As you are me
And we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun
See how they fly
I'm cryin’
Sitting on a cornflake
Waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt
Stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy
You let your face grow long
I am the egg man
They are the egg men
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob
Mister City, policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky
See how they run
I’m cryin', I'm cryin'
I'm cryin', I'm cryin'
Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog’s eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you’ve been a naughty girl
You let your knickers down
I am the egg man
They are the egg men
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don’t come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain
I am the egg man 
They are the egg men 
I am the walrus
Goo goo g'joob 
G-goo goo g'joob
Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don’t you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying
Semolina pilchard
Climbing up the Eiffel Tower
Elementary penguin singing Hare Krishna
Man, you should have seen them
Kicking Edgar Allan Poe
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob g-goo goo g'joob
Goo goo g'joob g'goo goo g'joob, goo goo
Joob Joob Joob
Umpa, umpa, stick it up your jumper 
Everybody's got one, everybody's got one 
“Villain, take my purse
If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body
And give the letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester
Seek him out upon the English Party
Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable villain
As duteous to the vices"
Here they are, The Beatles!
