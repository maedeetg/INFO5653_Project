But her eyes, they tantalize
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me
I'll take my chances, for romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
No, no, this, I can't believe
No, no, nay will she deceive
I can't believe that she'll ever, ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?
Oh, no, no, no, this, I can't believe
No, no, nay will she deceive
Don't take chances if your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
No, no, no, no, this, I can't believe
No, no, nay will she deceive
'Cause she's an angel sent to me
No, she's an angel sent to me
