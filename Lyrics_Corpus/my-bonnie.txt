Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I've gotta do
Is thank you, girl
Thank you, girl
I could tell the world
A thing or two about our love
I know, little girl
Only a fool would doubt our love
And all I've gotta do
Is thank you, girl
Thank you, girl
Thank you, girl, for loving me
The way that you do 
That's the kind of love
That is too good to be true
And all I've gotta do
Is thank you, girl
Thank you, girl
Oh, oh, you've been good to me
You made me glad when I was blue
And eternally I'll always be
In love with you
And all I've  gotta do
Is thank you, girl
Thank you, girl
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
