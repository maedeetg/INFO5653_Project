It's not the way you smile that touched my heart
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart
Uh, oh
Many, many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and I cry over you
What can I do?
Can't help myself
'Cause, baby, it's you 
Baby, it's you 
You should hear what they say about you, "cheat," "cheat"
They say, they say you never never never ever been true
Uh, oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm going to love you any old way
What can I do? And it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause, baby, it's you 
Baby, it's you 
Uh, oh
It doesn't matter what they say
I know I'm going to love you any old way
What can I do? When it's true
Don't want nobody, nobody
'Cause, baby, it's you 
Baby, it's you 
Don't leave me all alone 
Come on home 
'Cause, baby, it's you
