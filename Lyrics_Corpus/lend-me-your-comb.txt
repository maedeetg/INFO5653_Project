Whoa, I know
Unless he has a song
That field of corn, whoa
Would never see a plow
That field of a corn, whoa, whoa
Would be deserted now
A man is born, whoa
He ain't got no friends
No how, no how
Unless he has a song, now
Now, now, now, now, now, now
Did you ever wake up in the morninâ€™?
A man is born, whoa
He ain't got no friends
Nowhere, nowhere
Unless he has a song, now, now
Now, unless he has a song, now
A song, now
Well, yeah
Well, ah
Whoa, oh
