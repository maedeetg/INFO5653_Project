I saw her standing on the corner 
A yellow ribbon in her hair 
I couldn't stop myself from calling
"Well look a-there," 
"Wow, look a-there," 
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
I took one look and I was fractured 
I tried to walk but I was lame 
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
"Well, what's your name?" 
"Well, what's your name?" 
Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
A crazy stop, she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!
Well, I tried to speak but I just stuttered 
I saw the rising of the sun 
And all along, my heart was falling
"While you're the one," 
"While you're the one," 
Young blood, oh, young blood, yeah, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
Yeah, young blood, oh, young blood, yeah, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
