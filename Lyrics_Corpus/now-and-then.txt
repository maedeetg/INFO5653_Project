I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if I make it through
It's all because of you
And now and then
If we must start again
Well, we will know for sure
That I will 
love you
Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me
Always to return to me
I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if you go away
I know you'll never stay
Now and then
I miss you
Oh, now and then
I want you to be there for me
I know it's true
It's all because of you
And if I make it through
It's all because of you
