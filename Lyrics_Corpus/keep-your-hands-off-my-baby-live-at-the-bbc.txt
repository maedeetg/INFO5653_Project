The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--
 Yes?
 Hey! Listen!
 It's all changed, now, Brian They're not doing that, no actors
 It's all changed, now
 But this is what I wonder In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor, did you find that?
 No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film You should have seen the rest
 Yes?
 Rubbish!
 Was it, really?
 Even worse, yes
 Who was worst?
 Oh, Paul
 I see
 I think John was about the worst
 No, it was you
 Oh, Ringo was very good, he was, he's a good lad
 He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin Do you think that's right?
 He was miming
 You, too, with Jason
 Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?
 Beginning to look like that Now, then--
 All right, John. Can you hear me?
 Can you hear him? Hello!
 Not really I hope not I hope not!
 We brought you the flowers, Ring
 He's not allowed to talk
 Eh?
 We brought you the flowers
 Oh, good
 And the grapes
 Oh, I like grapes
 He likes grapes
 We've been to Portugal
 Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then
 Who?
