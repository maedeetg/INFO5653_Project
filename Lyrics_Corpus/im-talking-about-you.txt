Step inside love and stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay
You look tired, love
Let me turn down the light
Come in out of the cold
Rest your head on my shoulder
And kiss me goodnight
We are together
Now and forever, come my way
Los Paranoias
Invites you to 
To just enjoy us 
Come on you can  do it
Baby, come on and join the Los Paranoias
Just enjoy us
Los Paranoias
Oh! Los Paranoias!
Come on and join us
Harmony
Los Paranoias
Come on and join us
We're the Los Paranoias
We're here to sing for you
And what if you want us to
We will sing a little song for you
