Free 
as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, 
home and dry
Like a homing bird, I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel soâ€”
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home , home and dry
Like a homing bird, I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The love that we once knew?
Always made me feel so free
Free 
as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a 
bird
Free as a bird
Free as a 
bird
Ooh
Free
