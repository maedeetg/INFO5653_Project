What's that?
Caramel sunshine
Hey, hey, he-he-he-hey!
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
Woah
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na
Hey Jude, don't let me down
She has found you, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better, better
Better, better
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin
You're waiting for someone to perform with
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do
The movement you need is on your shoulder
Na na na na na na na na na
Mmm
Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Better, better, better, better, better, woah
