Well blue moon
Well blue moon
Blue moon, blue moon
Keep on shining bright
Blue moon, keep on shining bright
My baby back tonight
Blue moon, keep on shining bright
I said blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well blue moon of Kentucky
Just keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Well, it was on one moonlight night
With the stars shining bright
Wish blown high
Love said goodbye
Blue moon of Kentucky
Keep on shining
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue
