When you told me that you didn't need me anymore
You know I nearly broke down and died
Oh! Darling, please believe me
I'll never let you down
Believe me when I tell you
I'll never let you down
When you told me 
You know I nearly broke down and died
Oh! Darling, please believe me

Never do you no harm
