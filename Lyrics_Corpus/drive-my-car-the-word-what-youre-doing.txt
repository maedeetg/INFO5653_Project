If you've got trouble then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried, you can't be as worried as me 
You're quite content to be bad with all the advantage you had over me
Just 'cause you're troubled then don't bring your troubles to me
I don't think it's funny when you ask for money for things
Especially when you're standing there wearing diamonds and rings 
You think I'm soft in the head, well try someone softer instead pretty thing
It's not so funny when you know what money can bring
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two
