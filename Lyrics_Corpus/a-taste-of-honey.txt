A taste of honey!
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey 
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
That taste of honey 
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back  for the honey  and you
