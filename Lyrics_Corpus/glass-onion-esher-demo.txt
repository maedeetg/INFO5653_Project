We've been friends for oh so long
I let you share what's mine
When you mess with the girl I love
It's time to draw the line
Keep your hands  off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands  off my baby
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
I don't mind if you lend my clothes
But you will be in touch
There is something that you get straight
There's one thing you don't touch
Keep your hands  off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands  off my baby
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine
Keep your hands  off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands  off my baby
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine
 Whoa, keep your hands off my baby
She's mine 
You better watch yourself now
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
