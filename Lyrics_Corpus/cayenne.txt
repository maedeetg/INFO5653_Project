Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
Well I've a-got to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
Well come into my machine so we can move on out
I know a jumping little joint where we can jump and shout
It's not too far back on the highway not too long a ride
Well you take your car along and you park it outside
A little cutie takes your hat and you can thank her, ma'am
Well every time you're going to drive you find the joint is jammed
Oh Carol, don't let him steal your heart away
Well I've got to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
Well if you want to hear some music like the boys all play
Hold tight, tap your foot, don’t let it carry you away
Don’t let the heat overcome you ’cause they play so loud
While the music will intrigue you when they get a crowd
Well you can dance I know you wish you could
I got my eyes on you baby, ’cause you dance so good
Don’t let him steal your heart away
I’ve a-got to learn to dance if it takes me all night and day
Well I’ve a-got to learn to dance if it takes you all night and day
