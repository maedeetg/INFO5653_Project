Lay down your arms 
And surrender to me 
Lay down your arms 
And love me peacefully  yeah 
Use your arms for loving me
Baby, that's the way it's got to be 
There is no reason for you to declare
War on the one that loves you so
So forget the other boys because my love is real
Come off your battlefield
Lay down your arms 
And love me peacefully 
Lay down your arms 
And love me tenderly  yeah 
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't want to fight no more 
The weapons you're using are hurting me bad
But someday you're going to see
That my love for you baby, is the truest you've ever had
A Soldier of Love, that's hard to be
Lay down your arms 
And love me peacefully 
Lay down your arms 
And surrender to me  yeah 
Use your arms to squeeze and please because I'm the one that loves you so
 Baby, lay down your arms
 Baby, lay down your arms
