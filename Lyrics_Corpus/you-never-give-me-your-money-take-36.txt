Ain't no doubt about it
This must be love
One little kiss from you
And I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot-dang-gilly
It's silly
But I'm glad all over
Yeah, the goose pimples baby
'Cause I feel so good
When you cuddle me like you do
And I feel glad all over
Ooh mercy, I'm rock gone puppy
And I'm happy
And I'm glad all over
Your touch goes through me like an electric wire
Never thought to make love
It don't take much lookin' to see what I've got
But it shows, yeah, it shows
Come on, honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well, I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot-dang-gilly
It's silly, but I'm glad all over
Yeah!
Tried to tell you how I'm cooking inside
When we're cheek to cheek
My temperature is low
Fever is high
I can't speak, I'm too weak!
Well, come on honey Bonnie
Give me one more time
Every time you do
Well, I feel glad all over
Ooh baby, hot-dang-gilly
It's silly, but I'm glad all over
Hot-dang-gilly
It's silly, but I'm glad all over
Well, hot-dang-gilly
It's sill,y but I'm glad all over
