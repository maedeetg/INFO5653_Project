Please don't wake me up too late
Tomorrow comes, and I will not be late
Late today when it becomes tomorrow
I will leave and go away
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye
Songs that lingered on my lips
Excite me now and linger on my mind
Leave your flowers at my door
I leave them for the one who waits behind
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye
*Scat singing*
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye
Far away, my lover sings a lonely song
And calls me to his side
Where the sound of lonely drums invites me on
I must be by his side
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye
My love, goodbye
Goodbye
Ah-ha-ha-ha
Bye, bye
